# Strategy Changelog

This file documents EVPoly strategy architecture, decision flow, and change history.
When strategy logic/config is changed, add a new dated entry under `## Change Log`.

Current operator-facing behavior is summarized in `README.md` and `docs/*.md`.
This file is append-heavy history plus high-level architecture notes.
Older entries may reference env keys that were removed in later commits.

## Common Architecture

- Market discovery: strategy loops resolve active Polymarket markets by `symbol + timeframe + period_open_ts`.
- Proxy feeds:
  - Coinbase mid for `5m/15m/4h`
  - Binance trade/spot for `1h` (and EVcurve D1 internals where applicable)
- Base anchoring: each strategy stores/reloads period base price in `tracking.db` for restart safety.
- Decision -> Arbiter -> Trader:
  - Strategy emits `ArbiterExecutionRequest`
  - Arbiter applies dedupe / caps / invariants
  - Trader submits `LIMIT` / `FAK` (strategy-specific)
- Tracking:
  - Events in `trade_events`
  - Position lifecycle in `positions_v2`
  - Settlement in `settlements_v2`

## Strategy Flows

### `premarket_v1`
- Places pre-open ladder orders per timeframe/rung schedule.
- Uses configured price ladder + weight ladder + expiry/cancel schedules.
- Uses remote premarket alpha gate with local 50/50 fallback on transport-class alpha failures.
- Includes delayed TP worker for `15m/1h/4h` fills.

### `endgame_sweep_v1`
- Late-window sweep strategy near close with alpha-owned tick policy (`tick_offsets_ms`, submit stale guard).
- Uses proxy-vs-base direction + guard stack + FAK/limit routing as applicable.
- Holds to settlement (`no sell ladder`).

### `evcurve_v1`
- Uses plan3/plan-daily stats (`p_flip`) vs market ask.
- Core gate: `p_flip` cap, min samples, curve-derived `max_buy`, min-buy floor.
- Supports `15m/1h/4h/1d` (`5m` removed from EVcurve runtime path).
- 1d uses dedicated zero-flip and EV-gap sub-rules.

### `sessionband_v1`
- Uses plan4b session watch-starts + lead% price bands.
- Uses two late checkpoints (`tau=2`, `tau=1`) with remote alpha decisioning.
- Single-attempt-per-period option + fixed symbol sizing.

### `evsnipe_v1`
- Binance price-rule strategy for:
  - hit markets (`High >= strike` / `Low <= strike`)
  - close-at-time markets (`Close above/below/between`).
- Uses Binance trade stream for hit triggers and Binance `kline_1m` close stream for close/range triggers.
- Discovery is remote-first with local fallback.
- Executes fast FAK cross-spread buy on the winning token side.

### `mm_rewards_v1`
- Liquidity-rewards market-making strategy with four modes:
  - `quiet_stack`
  - `tail_biased`
  - `spike`
  - `sports_pregame`
- Uses local market discovery/ranking and remote alpha selection.
- Uses local preflight gate before quote submission.
- Uses quote refresh + scoped cancel/replace + refill-on-fill loop through arbiter/trader.

### `mm_sport_v1`
- Sports rewards market-making strategy (default disabled).
- Discovers pregame sports match markets from rewards API + CLOB market details.
- Quotes top-of-book BUY on both outcomes (maker-only, post-only), no ladder.
- Uses reward min-size floor with multiplier and a top-share ratio gate before quote placement.
- Uses literal SELL only for inventory exit (prestart window or post-fill inventory unwind mode).
- Pauses a market for 120 minutes after fills, then runs inventory unwind before resuming two-sided BUY quoting.

## Change Log

### 2026-03-21

- Shared symbol ownership + discovery/log hardening sweep (`src/symbol_ownership.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/evcurve.rs`, `src/sessionband.rs`, `src/polymarket_ws.rs`, `src/api.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - symbol ownership is now centralized: `DOGE/BNB/HYPE` are restricted to `endgame_sweep_v1` and `evsnipe_v1`; `evcurve_v1` and `sessionband_v1` bootstraps now filter those symbols out even if provided via env.
  - Coinbase routing hard rule enforced: `coinbase_product_id_for_market_symbol("DOGE")` now returns no mapping; no `DOGE-USD` Coinbase feed spawn path remains.
  - EVcurve default symbol universe changed to `BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP` (`EVPOLY_EVCURVE_SYMBOLS` default updated accordingly).
  - Polymarket WS market discovery defaults tightened to reduce crash pressure:
    - `EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_DISCOVERY_LIMIT` default `250` (from `1500`)
    - `EVPOLY_PM_WS_REFRESH_SEC` default `90` (from `30`)
  - discovery now prefers strategy scope targets, reuses last-good cache on failures, and applies discovery-specific backoff (`90s -> 180s -> 300s` capped).
  - active-market JSON handling is now bounded + typed in API discovery path (`get_all_active_markets_page_tagged`) to fail cleanly on malformed/oversized payloads.
  - arbiter/trader/MM logging pressure reductions:
    - `arbiter_dispatch_rejected` dedupe reason is aggregated to `arbiter_dispatch_rejected_dedupe_summary` (30s window),
    - batch success spam replaced by `batch_place_submit_summary` (30s window),
    - `entry_ack_empty_order_id` now emits immediate first-seen + 60s summaries (`entry_ack_empty_order_id_summary`) per `(strategy_id, token_id, response_status, signer_route)`,
    - `entry_execution_timing` now defaults to selective emit unless `EVPOLY_TRACE_ENTRY_EXECUTION_TIMING=true`.
  - MM rewards hot-loop telemetry is now change/transition based:
    - `mm_rewards_quote_plan` (fingerprint change or 60s heartbeat),
    - `mm_rewards_quote_skew_applied` (cooldown + material-change gate),
    - `mm_rewards_safe_buffer_applied` (cooldown + effective-change gate),
    - `mm_rewards_floor_size_upscaled` (aggregated per `(condition_id, token_id, side)` per loop),
    - `mm_rewards_inventory_janitor_snapshot` (count-change or 300s heartbeat),
    - `mm_rewards_state_action_mismatch` (transition or 30s heartbeat).
  - Polymarket WS unstable-feed logs moved to degraded/recovered + heartbeat model (market and user loops), replacing per-loop reconnect/error floods.

- `mm_sport_v1` depth-ratio quote sizing now hard-clamps each BUY quote to 50% of live available USDC notional (`src/main.rs`):
  - applies only when `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_QUOTE_SIZE_MODE=depth_ratio`.
  - available notional is computed from live `min(USDC balance, USDC allowance)` (cached refresh in MM sport loop).
  - per-side target shares are clamped before ratio/min-size/place checks so oversized depth-ratio quotes cannot exceed half of available USDC.
  - adds throttled telemetry on balance-check failures: `mm_sport_depth_ratio_balance_check_failed`.

- `mm_sport_v1` added a second quote sizing mode `depth_ratio` (as an alternative to multiplier sizing) with asymmetric per-side depth-based BUY sizing (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - new mode key: `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_QUOTE_SIZE_MODE` with values:
    - `multiple` (existing behavior)
    - `depth_ratio` (new behavior)
  - `depth_ratio` sizing logic:
    - computes quote size per side from each side’s own external top-bid depth (no forced equal side size),
    - uses base quote ratio = `50%` of `max_share_ratio` at/below `100k` top-bid shares,
    - for depth above `100k`, increases on a capped log curve up to `75%` of `max_share_ratio`,
    - applies a floor clamp to the default multiplier floor (`1.2x reward min size`) in this mode.
  - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_MAX_SHARE_RATIO` runtime default changed from `0.02` to `0.05`.
  - existing ratio watchdog/pause/cancel guards remain the hard cap enforcement path; this change affects quote sizing input, not the max-ratio safety gate itself.

### 2026-03-20

- `mm_rewards_v1` dust cleanup now runs automatically on the hourly redemption scheduler slot (default minute `22`) with expanded run telemetry (`src/trader.rs`):
  - dust cleanup is now piggybacked on redemption `scheduled_interval` passes (same hourly slot) instead of being manual-only.
  - runtime now emits scheduled sweep events:
    - `mm_dust_sell_scheduled_completed`
    - `mm_dust_sell_scheduled_failed`
  - dust cleanup now emits richer per-run summary telemetry:
    - `mm_dust_sell_summary` includes counts, reason buckets, and sampled row outcomes for robust dust-position auditability.
  - no new env knobs were introduced for dust scheduling in this change; schedule timing follows existing redemption slot configuration.

- Core startup market discovery is now skipped in MM-only runtime mode (`src/main.rs`, `src/market_discovery.rs`, `src/monitor.rs`):
  - when all core strategies are disabled (`premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`) and at least one MM strategy is enabled (`mm_rewards_v1` and/or `mm_sport_v1`), bot now skips startup BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP discovery and logs `core_discovery_skipped_mm_only`.
  - MM-only mode now initializes monitor markets with explicit fallback placeholders (`dummy_*_fallback`, including BTC) and skips the legacy 15-minute core period-discovery worker.
  - startup/current-market metadata prewarm loops are also skipped in MM-only mode so MM runtimes do not keep emitting core crypto discovery noise.
  - affects MM-only deployments where operator intentionally runs MM strategies without core crypto strategies.

- `mm_sport_v1` quote GTD expiry defaults and per-market sampling were updated for pregame sports MM quoting (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - default randomized quote expiry window changed from `65s..125s` to `300s..600s`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_QUOTE_EXPIRY_MIN_SEC=300`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_QUOTE_EXPIRY_MAX_SEC=600`
  - quote expiry randomization is now condition-scoped (market-scoped), so paired outcomes in the same market share the same sampled TTL window per quote cycle.
  - affects `mm_sport_v1` pregame sports markets across all discovered symbols/conditions.

- Tick-metadata rate-limit handling was hardened across order submit + prewarm loops (`src/api.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - API prewarm now checks cache before backoff gate and marks tick-metadata backoff on prewarm-side rate limits (`tick_size` / `fee_rate` / `neg_risk`) instead of repeatedly falling through.
  - tick-metadata backoff now also has a short global guard (in addition to per-token) so cross-token 429 bursts pause metadata fetches platform-wide briefly instead of immediately thrashing new token ids.
  - main order submit now fails fast when prewarm is explicitly blocked by tick-metadata backoff/rate-limit, avoiding immediate on-demand metadata retries.
  - runtime loops now parse `remaining_ms=` from metadata errors and defer retries accordingly:
    - `mm_sport_v1` BUY quote submit and inventory-exit SELL submit paths apply per-token-side backoff (`mm_sport_buy_backoff_tick_metadata`, `mm_sport_inventory_exit_backoff_tick_metadata`);
    - `mm_rewards_v1` selected-token prewarm retry and `evsnipe_v1` selected-token prewarm retry now use parsed remaining backoff windows instead of fixed short retries.
  - `mm_sport_v1` inventory-exit SELL failure handling now applies explicit capacity backoff (`mm_sport_inventory_exit_backoff_balance_allowance`) and periodically triggers local wallet-table drift reconcile (`mm_sport_inventory_reconcile_triggered`) on repeated `not enough balance / allowance` errors to clear stale strategy inventory attribution.
  - `mm_sport_v1` now runs an orphan-condition cancel sweep (`mm_sport_orphan_condition_cancel_sweep`): any MM Sport `OPEN` pending rows whose condition drops out of active discovery/fallback scope are explicitly canceled with retry cooldown, preventing lingering past-expiration duplicate quotes on the exchange UI.
  - MM Sport also rearms aged `RECONCILE_FAILED` rows with direct cancel-first handling (`mm_sport_reconcile_failed_rearmed`): bot now attempts exchange cancel by order-id, marks `CANCELED` on confirmation, and only falls back to `OPEN` rearm when cancel is unconfirmed.
  - affects MM Sport pregame quoting/exits, MM Rewards selected-market prewarm cycles (all enabled modes/timeframes), and EVSnipe refresh prewarm on discovered symbols.

- MM inventory drift reconcile now supports both `mm_rewards_v1` and `mm_sport_v1` via admin + wallet-sync path (`src/trader.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `scripts/wallet_history_sync.py`):
  - admin endpoint `POST /admin/mm/reconcile/inventory` now accepts `strategy_id` (`mm_rewards_v1` default; `mm_sport_v1` supported) and reconciles per strategy against `wallet_positions_live_latest_v1`.
  - wallet sync worker now calls reconcile for both MM strategies each run and aggregates repaired shares/status so strategy inventory attribution is repaired from live wallet snapshots.
  - affects MM inventory tracking/repair across all MM rewards and MM sport markets (all symbols/timeframes where those strategies hold inventory).

- `mm_sport_v1` now applies a simple WS bust-flow pause and randomized quote expiry cycle for pregame sports markets (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/polymarket_ws.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - market WS bridge now consumes public `last_trade_price` events and keeps a short per-token market-trade window used by MM Sport bust checks.
  - MM Sport bust trigger is now explicit (`bust_shares_1s >= 10000` by default over a `1s` window): if triggered at/under bid guard price, bot cancels MM Sport condition quotes and pauses quoting for a random `60s..300s`, then resumes normal ratio/depth re-evaluation.
  - MM Sport quote submission is now always post-only `GTD` with randomized expiration `65s..125s`; live orders are tracked with expiry and replaced after expiry via normal cancel/requote flow.
  - new env knobs:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_BUST_WINDOW_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_BUST_SHARES_1S`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_BUST_PAUSE_MIN_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_BUST_PAUSE_MAX_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_QUOTE_EXPIRY_MIN_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_QUOTE_EXPIRY_MAX_SEC`

- `mm_sport_v1` terminal fill persistence is now written atomically during MM Sport-owned reconciliation paths (`src/main.rs`):
  - when MM Sport sees terminal BUY fills from WS status updates or cancel/get-order reconciliation, it now writes canonical `ENTRY_FILL` (`entry_fill_order:<order_id>`) via `mark_pending_order_filled_with_event` instead of only flipping `pending_orders.status`.
  - canceled-with-partial-match BUY orders now persist matched units/notional into `trade_events`/`fills_v2`/`positions_v2` through the same atomic fill transition path.
  - prevents wallet-live MM Sport inventory from drifting out of strategy attribution after terminal reconciliations, so inventory exit logic can see real MM Sport exposure.

- `mm_sport_v1` cancel-state reconciliation was hardened to prevent exchange/live vs local/canceled drift (`src/main.rs`, `src/api.rs`):
  - MM Sport cancel path now requires cancel confirmation from CLOB response (`canceled` contains the specific `order_id`) before writing local `CANCELED`.
  - when cancel is unconfirmed, MM Sport now falls back to `get_order` terminal reconciliation (`FILLED`/`CANCELED`/`STALE`) and keeps rows active if exchange still reports live.
  - shared API single-order cancel transport now routes through CLOB batch-cancel endpoint (`cancel_orders([order_id])`) to avoid ambiguous single-cancel responses that could return empty-ID `not_canceled` payloads.
  - affects MM Sport quote/cancel/requote behavior across sports markets by preventing false local cancels that lead to duplicate live quotes.

- `mm_sport_v1` requote duplicate-order guard + pending-write fail-safe (`src/main.rs`):
  - normal BUY requote and inventory-exit SELL requote now block repost when cancel attempts are unresolved and the old order still remains active in `pending_orders` (new telemetry: `mm_sport_requote_blocked_unresolved_cancel`).
  - MM Sport order placement now fails closed if `pending_orders` upsert fails: runtime immediately attempts exchange cancel for the just-posted order and returns an error instead of continuing with untracked live exposure.
  - affects `mm_sport_v1` live quoting/exit paths across discovered sports markets by preventing same-side duplicate reposts under cancel/DB race conditions.

- `mm_rewards_v1` restart safety + auto-selection resilience + config-surface alignment (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - startup cancel-all skip flag is now runtime-configurable and defaults safe for MM rewards restarts:
    - `EVPOLY_STARTUP_CANCEL_ALL_SKIP_IF_MM_REWARDS` now defaults to `true` in runtime (was effectively hardcoded off).
    - when MM rewards is enabled and skip flag remains true, startup global cancel-all is skipped so weak-exit SELL continuity can survive restart.
  - auto/hybrid remote selection no longer fail-closes to empty on remote-alpha errors:
    - selection path now holds last-good active set for that cycle (`mm_rewards_auto_selection_hold_last_good`) instead of deselecting/canceling all active MM rewards conditions.
  - several MM rewards runtime knobs are now truly env-backed (previously hardcoded in runtime):
    - `EVPOLY_MM_RUNTIME_MODE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_HARD_DISABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_POLL_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REPRICE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_STALE_FALLBACK_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_COMPETITION_HIGH_FREEZE_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SCORING_SPREAD_EXTEND_CENTS`
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` across all non-sports MM-selected markets/timeframes/symbols (sports flow remains owned by `mm_sport_v1`).

- `mm_sport_v1` pause semantics were split into entry-fill pause and continuous ratio-block mode (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - pause-on-fill now arms only for inventory-increasing BUY entry fills (DB event path + WS matched-size path).
  - SELL/unwind fills no longer re-arm pause, so inventory exit is not interrupted by the same pause machine.
  - removed timer-based ratio pause (`EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_RATIO_BREACH_PAUSE_SEC` removed).
  - ratio breaches now enter continuous `ratio_blocked` state with cancel cooldown (`EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_RATIO_BREACH_CANCEL_COOLDOWN_MS`) and hysteresis-based recovery (`0.9 * max_share_ratio`, 2 consecutive healthy checks).
  - MM Sport loop defaults were tightened for faster event reaction:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_POLL_MS` default `250`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_EVENT_FALLBACK_POLL_MS` default `200`

- `mm_sport_v1` game-start handling and inventory-exit market retention were corrected (`src/main.rs`, `src/models.rs`):
  - pregame timers now use real match-start fields (`gameStartTime` / `startDate`) and no longer fall back to market end timestamps.
  - discovery now emits explicit missing-start filtering telemetry (`skipped_missing_start_time`) when pregame-only is enabled.
  - fallback inventory-market refresh keeps inventory-bearing conditions active until flat (not only inside prestart window).
  - pregame stop gate now allows inventory-exit flow to continue for inventory-bearing conditions.

- `mm_sport_v1` now has a dedicated per-cycle ratio/depth watchdog for currently quoted markets (`src/main.rs`):
  - checks active MM Sport BUY conditions (including one-sided drift) every loop.
  - uses WS orderbook first, then token-scoped polling fallback.
  - on breach (ratio/depth/one-sided), cancels the full condition pair, enters `ratio_blocked`, and applies short cancel cooldown to reduce churn.
  - added queue-ahead/front-ratio guard for live BUY orders:
    - per-order guard tracks `live_shares` and monotonic `ahead_shares` at price level;
    - runtime breach now includes front-ratio (`live / (ahead + live)`) not just visible top-depth ratio.
  - WS subscription scope now refreshes from active markets plus active MM Sport orders so event-driven checks stay scoped to live exposure.

- `mm_sport_v1` inventory pause/exit, queue guard, and cancel reconciliation were tightened for sports pregame markets across all discovered symbols/timeframes (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/api.rs`, `src/polymarket_ws.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - fill pause now gates inventory-only unwind until pause expiry; prestart windows (`T-60m`/`T-5m`) still allow forced exit behavior.
  - queue-ahead tracking is now strictly non-increasing for a live order; once `ahead_shares` reaches zero it is not reset upward unless the order context changes.
  - MM Sport cancel helper now marks local pending rows terminal only after successful exchange cancel or terminal reconciliation (`FILLED`/`CANCELED`/`STALE`), avoiding false local safety on cancel errors.
  - exposure freshness defaults were tightened:
    - `EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_STALE_MS`: runtime default `2500 -> 600`, env full example `1000 -> 600`.
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_WS_STALE_MS`: `2500 -> 600`.
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_RATIO_BREACH_CANCEL_COOLDOWN_MS`: `2000 -> 200`.
  - hardcoded pair baseline gate sizing (`1.2x`) is now env-configurable with `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_PAIR_BASELINE_QUOTE_SIZE_MULT` (default `1.2`).

- Pending-order reconciliation hardening for MM strategies (`src/tracking_db.rs`):
  - `update_pending_order_status` and `update_pending_order_status_batch_any` no longer downgrade `FILLED` rows to non-filled terminal states.
  - missing-entry-fill backfill now also considers rows with non-null `filled_at_ms` even if status changed from `FILLED`.
  - affects `mm_sport_v1`/`mm_rewards_v1` runtime safety against stale cancel-vs-fill races.

- `mm_rewards_v1` entry-cap default was changed to unlimited in the arbiter worker admission path (`src/main.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - `EVPOLY_MAX_MM_REWARDS_ENTRIES_PER_TIMEFRAME_PERIOD` now defaults to no cap (`usize::MAX`) when unset.
  - Env override remains supported: setting `EVPOLY_MAX_MM_REWARDS_ENTRIES_PER_TIMEFRAME_PERIOD=<integer>` enforces an explicit per-timeframe/period cap.
  - Affects MM Rewards across all symbols/timeframes (notably `1d` BTC buckets that previously hit default cap `20` and emitted `entry_invariant_blocked`).

### 2026-03-19

- `mm_sport_v1` discovery loop was hardened against CLOB rate-limit starvation (`src/main.rs`):
  - discovery no longer re-hammers every ~1s when no markets are selected; it now uses exponential backoff (`5s` to `5m`) for empty/error refreshes and tracks `next_discovery_attempt_ms`.
  - when CLOB market-detail fetch is rate-limited, strategy now falls back to Gamma slug lookup (`get_market_by_slug`) to recover token ids + game time and keep discovery alive.
  - added explicit rate-limit telemetry via `mm_sport_discovery_rate_limited` plus richer `mm_sport_discovery_refresh` counters (`clob_detail_rate_limited`, fallback counts, cache usage, backoff timing).
  - discovery keeps and reuses last-good market set during transient detail-fetch failures to avoid dropping active scope to zero.

- `mm_sport_v1` internal budget caps were removed from live quoting (`src/main.rs`):
  - removed MM Sport balance/allowance-derived BUY budget accounting and all budget-driven quote scaling/fallback branches.
  - quote size is now governed by configured strategy size plus existing depth/ratio/min-size gates only.
  - retained runtime safety for real exchange capacity failures (`mm_sport_buy_backoff_balance_allowance` + pair cancel on insufficient balance/allowance errors).
  - affected scope: MM Sport pregame rewards markets across all discovered sports match conditions.

- `mm_sport_v1` budget gating and collateral allowance parsing were hardened to prevent false zero-budget starvation (`src/main.rs`, `src/api.rs`):
  - MM Sport now reserves budget against its own active BUY notional only (instead of all strategies), so `mm_rewards_v1` open BUYs do not zero out MM Sport quote capacity.
  - USDC allowance lookup now falls back to the max allowance reported by CLOB when the configured exchange key resolves to zero/missing.
  - MM Sport budget now falls back to balance-based sizing when collateral allowance resolves to zero, preventing hard-stop when balance is available but allowance telemetry is stale/incomplete.
  - impact: MM Sport can keep quoting eligible markets when wallet collateral is available, while still enforcing strategy-local budget caps.

- `mm_sport_v1` quoting/exposure control was rewritten to remove ratio-based size shrinking and enforce strict pair-level watch/cancel behavior (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - removed per-side “shrink to fit ratio” path; normal quoting now uses strict ratio feasibility only.
  - if either side breaches `max_share_ratio`, MM Sport cancels both sides for that market and stays in watch mode until depth recovers.
  - buy sizing now applies a collateral budget precheck using `0.8 * min(USDC balance, USDC allowance)` with open-buy notional reservation; pair quotes are scaled or skipped when budget is insufficient.
  - on buy capacity errors (`not enough balance / allowance`), MM Sport cancels the market pair to prevent persistent one-sided quoting and enters cooldown.
  - `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_MAX_SHARE_RATIO` default remains `0.02` (runtime override supported).

- `mm_sport_v1` fill handling now uses a longer pause and post-pause inventory unwind flow (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - pause after fill default changed from `900s` to `7200s` (`EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_PAUSE_AFTER_FILL_SEC`).
  - after pause, if inventory remains, market enters inventory-exit mode (BUY quoting off, SELL unwind on) until flat.
  - once flat, strategy resumes normal two-sided BUY quoting.

- `mm_sport_v1` normal quoting now enforces a hard pair-level baseline feasibility gate before any side quote (`src/main.rs`):
  - hardcoded low-depth floor raised from `30,000` to `50,000` USD (`MM_SPORT_LOW_DEPTH_FLOOR_USD`).
  - new baseline gate requires both outcomes to support at least `1.2x` reward-min shares under `max_share_ratio` (default 2%): required external top shares per side = `baseline * (1-r)/r`.
  - if either side fails that baseline ratio gate, bot cancels both sides for the market and waits; quoting resumes only after both sides become feasible again.
  - BUY placement failures from balance/allowance errors now trigger a per-token BUY cooldown backoff (`30s`) before reattempt (`mm_sport_buy_backoff_balance_allowance`), reducing rapid retry spam while preserving normal quoting when capacity recovers.

- `mm_rewards_v1` + `mm_sport_v1` pending-order reconciliation now treats exchange unknown terminal states (notably `INVALID`) as terminal instead of `OPEN` (`src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - shared terminal helpers now classify unknown status strings into `FILLED` / `CANCELED` / `STALE`; `INVALID` maps to `STALE`.
  - MM stale-check paths now consider `Unmatched` and terminal unknown statuses as terminal for cleanup.
  - fixes stale `OPEN` rows that could block quote refresh and create apparent one-sided quoting even when exchange order is already invalid.
- `mm_sport_v1` websocket order-state loop now writes terminal WS statuses back to `pending_orders` immediately (`src/main.rs`):
  - on WS terminal status (`Matched`/`Canceled`/`Unmatched`/terminal unknown), DB status is updated in-loop (no wait for slower periodic reconcile).
  - reduces stale-open lag and prevents phantom “kept” rows from suppressing replacement orders on one side.

- Shared sizing-policy defaults are now env-overridable while keeping the same code defaults (`src/main.rs`, `src/size_policy.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - `premarket_v1` fixed ladder can now be overridden via:
    - `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_FIXED_LADDER_PRICES` (default `0.40,0.30,0.24,0.21,0.15,0.12`)
    - `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_FIXED_LADDER_WEIGHTS` (default `0.23,0.23,0.17,0.14,0.12,0.11`)
  - `endgame_sweep_v1` per-tick split can now be overridden via:
    - `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_TICK0_MULTIPLIER` (default `0.20`)
    - `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_TICK1_MULTIPLIER` (default `0.40`)
    - `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_TICK2_MULTIPLIER` (default `0.40`)
  - `sessionband_v1` tau multipliers can now be overridden via:
    - `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_TAU2_MULTIPLIER` (default `0.30`)
    - `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_TAU1_MULTIPLIER` (default `0.70`)
  - invalid env values fail closed to existing code defaults (no behavior change unless valid override is set).

- `evcurve_v1` fill-state tracking now has an explicit WSS-driven reconcile loop with polling fallback (`src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - when Polymarket WS is enabled, runtime now wakes on user-channel events and reconciles EVcurve pending orders via `api.get_order` (WS snapshot first, API fallback).
  - polling fallback is controlled by `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_FILL_FALLBACK_POLL_MS` (default `1500ms`) so fills still reconcile without fresh WS events.
  - existing global periodic reconcile path remains unchanged as a safety backstop.

- `mm_sport_v1` prestart inventory-exit reliability hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - added tolerant `game_start_time` parsing fallback formats so MM Sport can resolve start timestamps even when feeds return non-strict RFC3339 datetime strings.
  - added inventory-condition fallback refresh (`60s`) so open MM Sport positions can still enter prestart exit handling even if a condition temporarily falls out of normal reward discovery scope.
  - prestart SELL exits now bypass reward `min_size` floor and enforce exchange min-order floor only, preventing stuck sub-reward inventory during the `T-60m` to start exit window.
  - added forced `T-5m` exit mode: if inventory remains, MM Sport places one non-post-only SELL limit targeting level-2 bid (fallback level-1 when needed) to prioritize immediate flattening.
  - affects `mm_sport_v1` sports pregame inventory-exit path across all discovered symbols/markets; normal two-outcome BUY quoting logic is unchanged.

- `mm_sport_v1` budget handling now preserves valid live quotes and avoids collateral-starvation churn (`src/main.rs`):
  - pair-level budget gating now uses `effective_remaining_budget_usd = remaining_budget_usd + existing_market_buy_notional_usd` so already-posted MM Sport BUYs are treated as reusable budget during requote checks.
  - when configured high multiplier (for example `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_QUOTE_SIZE_MULT=10`) exceeds current effective budget, quoting falls back to baseline `1.2x` reward min-size before hard scaling to zero.
  - token-level budget clamps now also credit existing same-token BUY notional, preventing unnecessary cancel/repost loops caused by treating current live orders as fresh budget demand.
  - affects `mm_sport_v1` normal two-outcome BUY quoting only; fill-pause and inventory-exit behavior are unchanged.

- `mm_sport_v1` ratio-breach handling now hard-pauses affected markets for 15 minutes to stop cancel churn (`src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - when pair ratio checks fail (`mm_sport_skip_pair_ratio_limit_exceeded` or runtime `..._runtime`), MM Sport now cancels current orders for that condition and sets a 15-minute condition pause before re-checking.
  - added explicit `ratio_pause_until_ms` telemetry field on both ratio-breach events.
  - live runtime override updated to `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_MAX_SHARE_RATIO=0.05` in `.env` (previously `0.01`).
  - affects `mm_sport_v1` sports normal quoting path; fill-trigger pause (`EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_PAUSE_AFTER_FILL_SEC`) is unchanged.

### 2026-03-18

- `mm_sport_v1` normal quoting now uses pair-depth regimes to avoid one-sided high-mult quotes when one outcome book is thinner (`src/main.rs`):
  - computes external top-bid depth on both outcomes and uses pair minimum depth for regime selection.
  - if pair depth `< 30,000 USD`: cancels both sides and skips quoting that market (keeps monitoring).
  - if pair depth is `>= 30,000` and `< EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_MIN_TOP_DEPTH_USD` (default `100,000`): forces quote multiplier to hardcoded `1.2x` (code default).
  - if pair depth is `>= EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_MIN_TOP_DEPTH_USD`: uses normal configured multiplier (`EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_QUOTE_SIZE_MULT`).
  - normal per-side `100k` depth skip path was removed; depth gating is now pair-level before per-token ratio clamp.

- Docs/env surface alignment for 7-symbol rollout (`.env.full.example`, `docs/endgame_sweep_v1.md`, `docs/evcurve_v1.md`, `docs/evsnipe_v1.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`):
  - `.env.full.example` now sets `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_ENDGAME=8` to match runtime code default.
  - strategy guides now reflect 7-symbol defaults for endgame/evcurve/evsnipe (`BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP,DOGE,BNB,HYPE`) and updated symbol sizing notes.
  - operator/AI runtime docs now explicitly require `./ev` for live start/restart/status/log lifecycle.

- `mm_sport_v1` discovery refresh cadence is now hardcoded to `300s` with no env override (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - removed runtime env path `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_DISCOVERY_REFRESH_SEC`.
  - MM Sport discovery now always refreshes every 5 minutes regardless of env.

- `mm_sport_v1` now uses websocket-first eventing and side-clamped top-depth gating for quote size control (`src/main.rs`, `src/polymarket_ws.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - mm sport discovered token/condition scopes are now injected into polymarket WS subscription targets, enabling websocket-first orderbook and user-order/fill updates for sports markets.
  - loop wake path is now event-driven (`market` + `user` WS) with timeout fallback to polling (`EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_EVENT_FALLBACK_POLL_MS`).
  - added WS-assisted fill pause path (`mm_sport_market_paused_on_fill_ws`) that reacts to user-channel matched size deltas and triggers condition pause/cancel immediately.
  - max share ratio default tightened to `0.02` via `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_MAX_SHARE_RATIO` (from `0.10`).
  - added top-level external depth floor `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_MIN_TOP_DEPTH_USD` (default `100000`): side is skipped if external top depth is below floor.
  - normal BUY size is now clamped per side to satisfy ratio cap instead of all-or-none rejection; opposite side can continue quoting independently.

- `mm_sport_v1` quoting/execution behavior updated to reduce one-sided SELL failures and align post-fill sizing (`src/main.rs`):
  - normal quoting path now uses BUY-only on both outcomes (no literal SELL in normal mode).
  - post-fill resume sizing now boosts the opposite outcome BUY size by held inventory (`desired_buy = base_quote + opposite_inventory`), e.g. if A fills, B quote grows after pause.
  - normal-mode invalid side handling is now strategy-scoped per token side (stale/non-target rows canceled on that side) while preserving independent quoting on the opposite side.
  - literal SELL remains in the prestart inventory-exit window only (60 minutes before game start), preserving exit behavior while eliminating normal-mode SELL spam.

- `mm_rewards_v1` CBB priority/only paths were removed from runtime (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/bin/alpha_service.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `docs/mm_rewards_v1.md`):
  - removed `EVPOLY_MM_CBB_*` env surface and CBB-only/piority selection hooks.
  - removed CBB candidate metadata plumbing (`is_cbb`) from MM rewards discovery/selection payloads.
  - MM rewards now runs without CBB-specific bypass/selection behavior.

- Added new `mm_sport_v1` strategy runtime (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/strategy.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `docs/strategy_combos.md`):
  - new strategy toggle `EVPOLY_STRATEGY_MM_SPORT_ENABLE` (default `false`).
  - new MM Sport env surface (`EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_*`) for poll cadence, discovery refresh, reward/day threshold, quote size multiplier, max top-share ratio, fill-pause duration, and market filters.
  - discovery behavior: scans rewards markets, keeps sports pregame match markets only, requires reward-eligible params by default, and keeps rate/day `>= 300` by default.
  - quoting behavior: top bid + top ask only (per token), maker-only (`post_only=true` hard-enforced), no ladder, with strict ratio gate `our_size / (existing_top + our_size) < max_share_ratio` for both sides; if either side fails gate, both sides are canceled/skipped.
  - fill behavior: any `ENTRY_FILL` or `EXIT` event for `mm_sport_v1` pauses that market for `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_PAUSE_AFTER_FILL_SEC` (default 900s), cancels active orders for that condition, and resumes after pause with inventory-adjusted ask sizing.
  - tracking additions: `tracking_db.list_strategy_fill_events_since(...)` now exposes strategy-scoped fill stream (`ENTRY_FILL` + `EXIT`) used by MM Sport pause logic.

- `mm_sport_v1` sports discovery + pregame inventory-exit behavior updated (`src/main.rs`):
  - discovery now classifies sports markets using CLOB market tags/category (with slug fallback) instead of requiring `sports/...` slug prefixes, which restores CBB and other sports reward market discovery.
  - execution now enters inventory-exit mode exactly 60 minutes before `game_start_time`: BUY quoting is canceled/stopped, SELL exits are managed post-only on top ask, and pause-on-fill is bypassed during this prestart exit window.
  - exit submissions enforce MM-rewards-style minimum exit floor (`max(exchange_min_shares, reward_min_shares)`), and undersized inventory is skipped with explicit telemetry.
  - affects `mm_sport_v1` only (all sports symbols/timeframes discovered by rewards feed); non-MM-sport strategies unchanged.

- `mm_rewards_v1` now hard-excludes sports markets so MM Sport owns sports flow (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - hard-disabled `sports_pregame` mode in runtime defaults (`mode_enable_sports_pregame=false`) with no env override path.
  - auto candidate scan now rejects sports markets at source using market tags + slug classification before ranking/selection.
  - added runtime safety guard: if any sports market still reaches the MM rewards execution loop, MM rewards skips it and strategy-scoped cancels `mm_rewards_v1` pending orders for that condition.
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` only; cancellation path is strategy-scoped and does not touch `mm_sport_v1` orders.

- `endgame_sweep_v1` arbiter worker defaults and fastlane submit dispatch were adjusted for 7-symbol concurrency (`src/main.rs`):
  - default `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_ENDGAME` fallback changed from `2` to `8` when env is unset.
  - endgame fastlane submit path no longer blocks worker loop on `submit_task.await`; endgame requests now use spawned submit tasks like non-fastlane paths.
  - affects endgame execution queueing/submit concurrency across enabled endgame symbols/timeframes by reducing per-worker head-of-line blocking under bursty tick windows.

- `endgame_sweep_v1` proxy-source routing was hardcoded for the 7-symbol default universe (`src/main.rs`, `src/hyperliquid_wss.rs`, `src/lib.rs`):
  - `BNB` now uses Binance spot trade feed (`bnbusdt@trade`) for all enabled endgame timeframes.
  - `HYPE` now uses Hyperliquid spot trade feed (`HYPEUSDC`, hardcoded coin `@107`) for `5m/15m/4h`, and Binance trade feed for `1h`.
  - synthetic proxy snapshots are generated from Binance/Hyperliquid trade prints to preserve existing endgame planner interfaces (`CoinbaseBookState` path) with minimal strategy logic changes.
  - affects endgame proxy input path only; strategy toggles and endgame symbol default env (`EVPOLY_ENDGAME_SYMBOLS`) remain unchanged.

- `endgame_sweep_v1` DOGE path was aligned to XRP-style Coinbase routing (`src/main.rs`):
  - added `DOGE <-> DOGE-USD` Coinbase product mapping in shared market-symbol helper functions used by endgame feed bootstrap.
  - DOGE now uses the same Coinbase level2 proxy path as BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP in endgame.

- `endgame_sweep_v1` DOGE proxy-source default was hard-switched to Binance to mirror BNB (`src/main.rs`):
  - `endgame_proxy_source_for_symbol_timeframe(...)` now routes `DOGE` to Binance (`dogeusdt@trade`) for all enabled endgame timeframes.
  - removes Coinbase as the endgame proxy feed source for DOGE while preserving existing synthetic snapshot/planner interfaces.

- Endgame/trader symbol attribution was corrected for `DOGE/BNB/HYPE` submit telemetry (`src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - `entry_execution_timing.asset_symbol` now prefers symbol extraction from `request_id` (e.g. `...:doge:...`) instead of falling back to token-type family (`BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP` only).
  - `trade_events.asset_symbol` now uses `reason.request_id` symbol fallback when token-type label cannot represent extended symbols, so endgame `ENTRY_SUBMIT` rows keep `DOGE/BNB/HYPE` attribution.

- Shared timeframe slug helpers were extended for `DOGE/BNB/HYPE` (`src/main.rs` tests + helpers):
  - added normalize/slug-prefix/H1-D1 asset prefix handling so discovery validation accepts these symbols across `5m/15m/1h/4h` naming paths.
  - touched code paths: `normalize_market_symbol`, `market_symbol_slug_prefixes`, `h1_symbol_from_market_slug`, `h1_market_slug_matches_target_open_ts` fallback symbol set, and `h1_event_slug_asset_prefix`.

- `endgame_sweep_v1` submit stale allowance now applies a hardcoded symbol multiplier for the new 3 symbols (`src/main.rs`):
  - runtime now multiplies remote alpha `submit_proxy_max_age_ms` by `3x` for `DOGE`, `BNB`, and `HYPE` before enqueueing endgame requests.
  - the effective value is now used in arbiter request proxy-age override and endgame execution telemetry payloads (`alpha_submit_proxy_max_age_ms`).
  - affects endgame proxy-stale gating across enabled endgame timeframes for `DOGE/BNB/HYPE` only; other symbols keep the unscaled remote alpha value.

- `sessionband_v1` fastlane submit dispatch now uses nonblocking worker submit scheduling (`src/main.rs`):
  - arbiter fastlane worker path now spawns `sessionband_v1` submit tasks instead of awaiting each submit inline.
  - aligns sessionband with endgame fastlane behavior to reduce worker head-of-line blocking during bursty periods.
  - affects sessionband execution queueing/submit concurrency across enabled sessionband symbols/timeframes.

- `evsnipe_v1` arbiter worker default pool size fallback increased (`src/main.rs`):
  - default `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_EVSNIPE` fallback changed from `2` to `4` when env is unset.
  - affects EVSnipe arbiter execution parallelism defaults for EVSnipe entry submits (all EVSnipe symbols/timeframes).

- Shared FAK/FOK BUY precision alignment now probes taker scale from token tick-size instead of price scale fallback only (`src/api.rs`):
  - submit path now fetches token `minimum_tick_size` and uses `minimum_tick_size` decimal scale + `2` as the taker probe scale for cent-step USDC notional alignment, with fallback to the previous `price.scale() + 2` behavior if tick-size fetch fails.
  - affects immediate BUY submit precision gating across strategies that use shared `place_order` FAK/FOK BUY path (`endgame_sweep_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, and other FAK/FOK BUY callers) for all enabled symbols/timeframes.
  - objective is to reduce exchange precision rejects (`maker <= 2`, `taker <= 4`) on markets with finer token tick sizes (for example `0.001`).

### 2026-03-17

- Shared size policy symbol multiplier defaults expanded to include `DOGE/BNB/HYPE` at `0.5` (`src/size_policy.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - `symbol_size_multiplier(...)` now returns `0.5` for `DOGE`, `BNB`, and `HYPE` (same as `SOL/XRP`), instead of falling back to `1.0`.
  - affects default notional sizing in strategies that use shared base-size policy (`premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`) when those symbols are enabled.
  - added unit-test coverage for `DOGE/BNB/HYPE` multiplier behavior.

- Strategy default symbol universe expanded to full 7-symbol set for endgame/evcurve/evsnipe (`src/config.rs`, `src/evcurve.rs`, `src/bot_admin.rs`, `.env.full.example`, `.env`):
  - `endgame_sweep_v1` env/code fallback default now uses `BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP,DOGE,BNB,HYPE` when `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_SYMBOLS` is unset.
  - `evcurve_v1` env/code fallback default now uses `BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP,DOGE,BNB,HYPE` when `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_SYMBOLS` is unset.
  - `evsnipe_v1` templates/runtime env defaults are aligned to explicit `BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP,DOGE,BNB,HYPE` (`EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_SYMBOLS`).
  - affects symbol fanout defaults across configured timeframes for these three strategy paths.
- `mm_rewards_v1` now enforces reward minimum share size on SELL/exit order paths when reward-min enforcement is enabled and the market side is reward-eligible (`src/main.rs`):
  - weak-exit sell replacement and inventory-reduction sell paths now compute `min_exit_shares` as `max(exchange_min_shares, reward_min_shares_with_policy)` instead of exchange floor only.
  - this keeps MM-reward exit quotes at reward-qualifying share size (including inventory unwind/rebalance ladders), avoiding sub-min-size SELL quotes that forfeit rewards.
  - affected knobs/code paths: `reward_min_size_enforce`, `mm_reward_min_shares_with_policy`, and SELL `min_exit_shares` calculation in MM rewards loop.
### 2026-03-16

- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-exit stale balance fallback is now hard-disabled in runtime (`src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - `weak_exit_stale_fallback_enable` is hardcoded to `false` (no env toggle path).
  - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_STALE_FALLBACK_ENABLE` is now ignored by runtime config.
  - affects all MM rewards modes (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`) across configured symbols/timeframes by preventing cached-stale-balance weak-exit submits.

- `premarket_v1` now has delayed take-profit limit placement via a dedicated non-blocking TP worker queue (`src/trader.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - applies only to `15m/1h/4h` premarket positions (`5m` excluded).
  - TP scheduling starts at `T+5m` from market launch (`period_timestamp + 300s`).
  - worker retries every `30s` until API position basis is available (`avg entry` + `position size`), then places SELL LIMIT TP.
  - TP price rule: `max(entry*2, top_ask, 0.60)` with tick alignment before submit.
  - queue/enqueue path is `try_send` with bounded capacity and per-trade inflight/retry state, so TP API calls/timeouts do not block pending-trade loop or other strategies.
  - runtime toggle added: `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_TP_ENABLE` (default `true`).

- `mm_rewards_v1` preflight gate moved back to local runtime evaluation while keeping alpha parity for scoring/full-ladder logic (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/scoring_guard.rs`, `docs/mm_rewards_v1.md`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `scripts/remote_onboard.py`, `README.md`):
  - MM remote alpha is now selection-only (`EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_SELECTION_ALPHA_URL` + `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_ALPHA_TOKEN`).
  - bot-side preflight now uses the same scoring/Q-min bypass/full-ladder rules as alpha service preflight handler, but evaluated in-process before rung submission.
  - removed runtime/env onboarding dependency on `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_PREFLIGHT_ALPHA_URL`.

- Manual close chase-limit replace flow now actively reprices stale working orders even when order lookup succeeds (`src/bin/manual_bot.rs`):
  - in `/manual/close` chase mode, inflight non-terminal orders older than settle window are now marked stale and canceled/reconciled before next quote pass, instead of waiting on lookup-error path only.
  - stale-cancel reconcile now records terminal state from post-cancel status check rather than forcing terminal on any successful reconcile read.
  - affects manual close execution (`/manual/close`, `ChaseLimit`) for all symbols/timeframes by restoring continuous cancel/requote behavior on drifting prices.

- `evsnipe_v1` market discovery was realigned to Poly-builder behavior for both bot fallback and remote alpha output (`src/evsnipe.rs`, `src/bin/alpha_service.rs`):
  - local discovery now uses Gamma crypto-tag paging (`tag_slug=crypto`) with event-offset stepping (`offset += page_limit`), matching Poly-builder event-pagination semantics and avoiding market-window skips caused by flattened-market offset stepping.
  - fallback/local page-0 retry remains, but now retries the same crypto-tag path at smaller page size (`200`) for rate-limit resilience.
  - alpha service EVSnipe cache prewarm now calls the local-only EVSnipe discovery path directly, so `/v1/discovery/evsnipe` serves the same discovery set as Poly-builder logic instead of depending on upstream remote EVSnipe discovery config.
  - alpha service EVSnipe cache now also applies strike-distance anchor filtering before publishing specs (same `abs(strike-anchor)/anchor <= EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_STRIKE_WINDOW_PCT` behavior used by bot runtime), reducing remote discovery payload size and aligning remote served set with bot tradable watchlist.
  - affects EVSnipe hit/close market discovery coverage across configured symbols (`BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP`) and expiry-window filtering.

- `mm_rewards_v1` remote alpha defaults were normalized to public HTTPS domains (no localhost fallback profile for remote MM endpoints) (`src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - runtime default URL fallback keys `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_SELECTION_ALPHA_URL` and `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_PREFLIGHT_ALPHA_URL` now default to `https://alpha.evplus.ai/...`.
  - repository `.env` MM remote alpha URL values were updated from `127.0.0.1` to public `alpha.evplus.ai` endpoints.

- Shared submit metadata prewarm + MM/EVSnipe selective prewarm were hardened against tick-size rate-limit storms (`src/api.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - shared order build path now applies token-level rate-limit backoff for tick metadata (`base=1000ms`, `max=30000ms`) and skips immediate metadata retry when first build failure is rate-limited (`429/1015`), while preserving existing retry path for non-rate-limit failures.
  - MM loop now prewarms only currently-selected market token IDs (UP/DOWN), with bounded per-loop token budget + cooldown, instead of broad metadata churn; EVSnipe refresh loop now does the same for discovered hotset tokens.
  - MM constraint/cache cooldown knobs are now hardcoded in runtime (`constraints cache=30000ms`, constraints failure cooldown `60000ms`, market-details failure cooldown `60000ms`) and removed from env template surface.
  - affects submit-path resilience and metadata call pressure across strategy submits (including `premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, `mm_rewards_v1`), with direct behavioral impact on `mm_rewards_v1` and `evsnipe_v1` prewarm cadence.

- Redeem path now includes neg-risk adapter handling plus post-submit effect verification (`src/api.rs`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - redeem/merge closeout flow now attempts neg-risk adapter redeem (`redeemPositions(bytes32,uint256[])`) for neg-risk markets and falls back to CTF redeem path when adapter payload is unavailable or fails.
  - redemption success state now requires verified effect (condition disappears from live redeemable set); relayer-confirmed submits without observed effect are kept in retry/submitted state instead of final success.
  - affects settlement/closeout behavior for all strategies that rely on redemption lifecycle (`premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, `mm_rewards_v1`).

- Remote alpha/discovery timeout surface cleanup + EVSnipe hard timeout (`src/main.rs`, `src/evsnipe.rs`, `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - premarket/endgame/evcurve/sessionband remote alpha timeouts remain hardcoded at `1000ms` in runtime (no env control path).
  - EVSnipe remote discovery timeout is now hardcoded at `2000ms` (removed `EVPOLY_REMOTE_EVSNIPE_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` env path).
  - runtime env templates and local `.env` removed stale timeout keys for those strategy alpha/discovery timeout values.
  - local runtime `.env` alpha/discovery URLs were switched back to public `https://alpha.evplus.ai/...` endpoints.
  - affects remote alpha/discovery request behavior for `premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, and `evsnipe_v1`.

### 2026-03-15

- `premarket_v1` submit cap guard was hardcoded to `48` per token-side (`src/main.rs`, `docs/premarket_v1.md`, `.env.full.example`):
  - removed env override path `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_SUBMIT_CAP_PER_TOKEN`.
  - reason: prevent SOL/XRP premarket ladders from getting blocked when BTC/ETH consume inflight submit budget in the same timeframe window.

- Redeem/merge relayer submit priority was flipped to local-key primary with remote signer fallback (`src/api.rs`, `scripts/remote_onboard.py`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `README.md`):
  - for redeem/merge submit paths, `RELAYER_API_KEY` + `RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS` is now attempted first when configured.
  - if local relayer-key submit fails (or is missing/misconfigured), bot falls back to remote signer submit path.
  - onboarding now prints a clear action note to fetch relayer keys from:
    `https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=api-keys`
    and set them in `.env` (or ask AI to fill).

- Runtime submission/discovery/balance pressure controls were hardened with hardcoded values and reduced env surface (`src/api.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/bot_admin.rs`, `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `scripts/remote_onboard.py`):
  - USDC balance+allowance cache windows increased to `hit=60s` and `fallback=180s`, plus singleflight gating so only one in-flight collateral `/balance-allowance` fetch runs at a time.
  - USDC balance+allowance fetch no longer performs immediate second attempt when first failure is rate-limit (`429/1015`); it now falls back to cached snapshot if valid or returns error.
  - redemption/merge available-ratio auto-trigger checks now reuse a hardcoded cached USDC snapshot window (`300s`) instead of forcing a fresh balance call on every closure scheduler pass.
  - remote timeframe market discovery timeout is hardcoded to `2000ms` (no env override).
  - latency-critical order submit retry defaults are hardcoded low (`order_api_attempts=1`, signer rate-limit retries `=1`), while non-critical maintenance/reconcile retry paths remain unchanged.
  - removed now-unused order submit retry env knobs from templates (`EVPOLY_ORDER_API_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `EVPOLY_ORDER_API_RETRY_BASE_MS`).

- `premarket_v1` ladder and dispatch defaults were tightened and hardcoded (`src/main.rs`, `src/bin/manual_bot.rs`, `.env`, `.env.full.example`, `docs/premarket_v1.md`):
  - fixed ladder reduced from `10x10` to `6x6` per side with hardcoded prices:
    `0.40,0.30,0.24,0.21,0.15,0.12`
    and normalized hardcoded weights:
    `0.23,0.23,0.17,0.14,0.12,0.11`.
  - premarket worker/scope-lane controls are now hardcoded and no longer env-driven:
    - `entry worker count = 4`
    - `scope lane max = 48`
    - `scope lane queue cap = 32`
  - removed obsolete premarket discovery env knobs (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_DISCOVERY_RETRIES`, `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_DISCOVERY_DEADLINE_SEC`) and removed now-dead remote discovery timeout/fallback env onboarding writes.

- `evsnipe_v1` discovery now runs remote-first with automatic local fallback instead of fail-closed remote-only (`src/evsnipe.rs`, `src/bin/alpha_service.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `docs/evsnipe_v1.md`, `AGENTS.md`):
  - `refresh_hit_market_specs(...)` now attempts remote EVSnipe discovery first and falls back to local Gamma paging/market-spec parsing when remote transport/status/data is unavailable.
  - restored local EVSnipe market-spec extraction/parsing helpers (symbol/rule/strike/token/end-ts parsing) used only for fallback path.
  - alpha service EVSnipe discovery prewarm default cadence changed from `30s` to `60s` (`DEFAULT_EVSNIPE_REFRESH_SEC`) to reduce refresh pressure.
  - affects `evsnipe_v1` discovery across default symbols (`BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP`) and all EVSnipe market families (hit + close/range) by keeping discovery available during remote alpha interruptions.

- Core balance-poll pressure controls were tightened by hardcoding slower intervals and longer USDC cache hit TTL (`src/config.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/api.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - removed env override surface for `POLY_MARKET_CLOSURE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` and hardcoded closure worker interval to `60s` regardless of `config.json`/env values.
  - increased shared pending-trade loop interval in main runtime from `500ms` to `15s` (path that calls `check_pending_trades()` and balance-only checks).
  - increased `USDC_BALANCE_CACHE_HIT_TTL_MS` from `2000ms` to `20000ms` to reduce repeated `/balance-allowance` hits.
  - affects shared post-entry/closure polling behavior across strategy flows that rely on trader pending/closure workers (`premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, `mm_rewards_v1`).

- Remote alpha/discovery URL defaults are now hardcoded in runtime config resolution (`src/main.rs`, `src/evsnipe.rs`, `src/bot_admin.rs`):
  - when env URL keys are blank/missing, bot now falls back to built-in defaults:
    - Premarket: `https://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/alpha/premarket/should-trade`
    - Endgame: `https://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/alpha/endgame/policy`
    - EVcurve: `https://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/alpha/evcurve`
    - SessionBand: `https://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/alpha/sessionband`
    - MM selection/preflight: `http://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/alpha/mm-rewards/{selection|preflight}`
    - Market discovery: `https://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/discovery/timeframe`
    - EVSnipe discovery: `https://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/discovery/evsnipe`
  - startup/runtime missing-config warnings now treat those URL keys as defaulted (token checks remain unchanged).
  - affects remote decision/discovery routing defaults for `premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, and `mm_rewards_v1`.

- Removed global exposure cap gating from runtime entry flow (`src/trader.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/bot_admin.rs`, `.env`, `.env.full.example`, `config.json`):
  - deleted both hard and soft cap checks previously tied to `POLY_MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_USD` (`filled` and `filled+working` gate paths), including exposure reject cooldown logic.
  - removed config/env/admin setting surface for `POLY_MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_USD` so cap behavior cannot be toggled back on via runtime settings.
  - affects entry gating across strategy execution modes by eliminating global exposure-based rejects (`risk_reject` hard/soft exposure paths).

- `mm_rewards_v1` merge execution now performs immediate per-condition fallback when batch merge submit fails (`src/trader.rs`):
  - merge sweep still submits batched merge requests first, but when batch submit errors or returns `success=false`, it now retries each condition immediately via single-condition `merge_complete_sets` (which includes adapter -> CTF target fallback logic).
  - manual condition merge path (`/manual/merge` with `condition_id`) now uses single-condition merge submit directly instead of one-item batch submit, so it gets the same immediate target fallback behavior.
  - affects MM merge/redeem inventory settlement flow only (`merge_sweep` / `merge_manual` paths); no quote policy or entry sizing changes.

- `premarket_v1` now applies adaptive DB-contention load shedding in hot submit paths (`src/main.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`):
  - arbiter premarket caps auto-scale when DB lock wait p95 rises, covering active-cap, submit-cap, and ladder rungs per side.
  - added DB contention telemetry/alert loop and throttle events (`premarket_db_contention_throttle`, `db_contention_alert`) plus late-guard burst alerting.
  - key env surface: `EVPOLY_DB_CONTENTION_*`, `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_DB_THROTTLE_*`, `EVPOLY_LATE_GUARD_ALERT_*`.
  - affects `premarket_v1` across configured symbols/timeframes by reducing submit pressure during lock contention.

- Pending-order reconcile status writes now support batched flush semantics to cut DB write churn (`src/trader.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`):
  - trader reconcile/startup flows aggregate status transitions and flush grouped updates.
  - new tracking-db helper `update_pending_order_status_batch_any` batches updates with fallback to per-row on error.
  - affects shared reconcile paths used by strategy pending-order lifecycle handling (including premarket/MM inventory-reconcile loops).

- Remote alpha/discovery HTTP calls now auto-failover from `alpha.evplus.ai` to `alpha2.evplus.ai` on transient primary failures (`src/main.rs`, `src/evsnipe.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - for remote endpoints whose configured URL host is `alpha.evplus.ai`, runtime retries once against same path/query on `alpha2.evplus.ai`.
  - failover triggers on transport timeout/connect/request errors and primary HTTP `408`, `429`, or `5xx`.
  - non-transient client errors (`4xx` other than `408`/`429`) remain fail-closed with no backup retry.
  - affected flows: timeframe discovery, EVSnipe discovery, premarket alpha, endgame alpha, EVcurve alpha, SessionBand alpha, MM rewards selection/preflight alpha.

- `mm_rewards_v1` added a local reward-min-size market filter gate to skip quoting when market `rewards.min_size` exceeds an operator-defined ceiling (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - new env: `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_REWARD_MIN_SIZE` (default `0` = disabled).
  - gate compares local market details `min_size` against configured max and emits `mm_rewards_skip_reward_min_size_filtered` before orderbook/scoring/quote flow.
  - unit follows existing `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_SIZE_UNIT` (`shares`/`usd`), so threshold semantics align with current MM reward-min policy settings.
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` across all MM modes (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`) for all selected symbols/timeframes.

### 2026-03-14

- `mm_rewards_v1` now runs fail-closed on remote alpha for auto-selection + preflight gates, removing local alpha decision fallback paths (`src/main.rs`, `src/bin/alpha_service.rs`, `scripts/remote_onboard.py`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `docs/mm_rewards_v1.md`, `README.md`):
  - bot-side MM auto mode assignment/selection now calls remote endpoints (`/v1/alpha/mm-rewards/selection`) and no longer executes local `select_top_candidates_by_reward` / local force-include decision logic as fallback.
  - bot-side MM preflight scoring/full-ladder gating now calls remote endpoint (`/v1/alpha/mm-rewards/preflight`) and blocks quoting when remote MM alpha is missing/unavailable (`remote_alpha_not_configured` / `remote_alpha_unavailable`).
  - added MM remote alpha env surface:
    - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_SELECTION_ALPHA_URL`
    - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_PREFLIGHT_ALPHA_URL`
    - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_ALPHA_TOKEN`
    - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MM_REWARDS_ALPHA_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `1000`)
  - onboarding helper now writes MM remote alpha URLs/token alongside existing strategy alpha keys.
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` across all MM-enabled symbols/timeframes/modes by making quote-policy alpha decisions remote-authoritative.

- `mm_rewards_v1` auto market discovery/rotation refresh cadence default was increased from `60s` to `900s` (`15m`) (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env.full.example`, local `.env`):
  - changed default env fallback for `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_REFRESH_SEC` to `900` in MM config parsing.
  - changed MM runtime fallback values tied to `auto_refresh_sec` from `60` to `900` in background refresh + auto-selection refresh paths.
  - affects MM rewards auto market selection and competition snapshot refresh timing across MM-selected markets/timeframes/symbols (`mm_rewards_v1`).

- `mm_rewards_v1` MM precheck notional hard cap now has a floor clamp of `$20.00` in trader pre-submit validation (`src/trader.rs`):
  - hard cap formula changed from `max(target*1.05, target+0.50)` to `max(target*1.05, target+0.50, 20.0)`.
  - affects all MM rewards symbols/timeframes when exchange min-order floors upsize small target notionals.

- `mm_rewards_v1` competition-level filter code default is now narrowed to `low,medium` when `EVPOLY_MM_COMPETITION_LEVEL_ALLOWLIST` is unset/empty (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - env override still fully controls behavior (supports explicit `low/medium/high/unknown` or `all/*`).
  - invalid/unknown-only env values now safely fall back to `low,medium` instead of broad allow-all.

- `mm_rewards_v1` market-details refresh now applies a per-condition cooldown after rate-limit failures when stale reward snapshots are already cached (`src/main.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - on `429` / `Too Many Requests`, MM records a short retry-after window (`EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_DETAILS_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_MS`, default `30000` ms) and reuses cached market details during cooldown instead of repeatedly refetching the same market metadata.
  - when stale details are already cached, MM now skips extra same-cycle 429 retries and immediately falls back to cached details + cooldown, reducing avoidable request bursts under heavy MM dispatch.
  - this targets MM auto-scan + quote refresh loops across all modes/timeframes/symbols, reducing rate-limit pressure without changing order placement logic or reward-floor sizing.

- `mm_rewards_v1` submit-path metadata prewarm now uses token-level singleflight protection to avoid duplicate concurrent metadata fetches for the same token under parallel MM dispatch (`src/api.rs`):
  - when multiple workers try to prewarm the same token at once, only one request fanout (`tick_size`/`fee_rate`/`neg_risk`) is allowed; other workers wait briefly and reuse the warmed cache.
  - this reduces CLOB metadata endpoint burst pressure and cuts `Failed to build order ... /tick-size ... 429` submit errors without changing order sizing/price policy.

- `mm_rewards_v1` constraint handling was hardened to avoid transient-read failures turning into entry failures under high dispatch load (`src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - MM loop now primes trader-side market-constraint cache from already-fetched MM constraint snapshots before entry submits (`prime_market_constraints_snapshot` path).
  - MM loop now allows transient stale-constraint fallback when fresh constraint refresh fails with read-transient signatures (`429` / timeout / gateway), using recent cached constraints for a bounded window (`~max(120s, 6x EVPOLY_MM_CONSTRAINTS_CACHE_MS)` in loop logic).
  - trader-side `market_order_constraints` now supports bounded stale-cache fallback on transient constraint fetch errors via `EVPOLY_CONSTRAINT_CACHE_STALE_FALLBACK_MS` (default `900000` ms), instead of failing immediately with `market_not_ready` when recent cached constraints exist.
  - `mm_rewards_notional_floor_exceeds_budget` is now treated as an explicit MM skip path (`mm_rewards_skip_notional_floor_budget`) rather than a submit error when exchange floor upsize exceeds per-order MM budget policy (`src/trader.rs`).
  - order metadata prewarm (`tick_size`/`fee_rate`/`neg_risk`) now fails open during submit path: transient prewarm failures no longer hard-fail order submits and instead continue with on-demand metadata fetch (`src/api.rs`).
  - affected scope: `mm_rewards_v1` across all MM-selected symbols/timeframes/modes (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`) where entries pass through shared trader constraint precheck.

### 2026-03-13

- Strategy enable defaults were aligned to run five core strategies by default and keep MM rewards off by default (`.env.full.example`, `.env.example`, `src/config.rs`, `src/evcurve.rs`, `src/sessionband.rs`, `src/evsnipe.rs`, `src/bot_admin.rs`):
  - default-on: `premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`.
  - default-off: `mm_rewards_v1`.
  - `.env.full.example` strategy toggles now match this profile and `.env.example` now includes the same strategy toggle block.
  - runtime fallback defaults (when env is unset) were changed to `true` for endgame/evcurve/sessionband/evsnipe while MM remains `false`; this affects default startup behavior across default symbols/timeframes (`BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP` with `5m/15m/1h/4h`, plus EVcurve `1d` where configured).

- `mm_rewards_v1` env surface was simplified to avoid confusion between base quote size and reward floor multiplier (`.env`, `.env.full.example`, `src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - removed `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_SHARES_PER_SIDE` from local/runtime env and full example template so MM now uses code default when unset.
  - effective default base quote size for MM remains `5.0` shares from code (`MmRewardsConfig::from_env`).
  - reward-floor scaling remains controlled by `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_TARGET_MULT` (not by `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_SHARES_PER_SIDE`).
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` quote sizing across all MM-selected symbols/timeframes/modes.

- `manual_bot` manual execution API was synced to `Poly-builder` endpoint/run-control behavior while preserving poly-oss signing/auth flow (`src/bin/manual_bot.rs`):
  - route surface now includes explicit open/close controls and run views: `/manual/open`, `/manual/close`, `/manual/open/stop`, `/manual/close/stop`, `/manual/open/runs*`, `/manual/close/runs*` (plus existing health/redeem/merge/positions/balance/pnl/audit/doctor paths).
  - semantics tightened:
    - `/manual/open` is BUY path,
    - `/manual/close` is reduce-only SELL path,
    - `tp_price` is accepted for open-only and rejected on close (`400`).
  - close-run safety includes duplicate scope conflict guard (`action+condition+token`), overlap prevention, cancel confirmation + post-cancel fill reconciliation, and stronger terminal status/stop_reason transitions for stop/timeout/cancel outcomes.
  - affects manual execution flows (`manual_open*`, `manual_close*`) without changing strategy runtime loops.

- Strategy/arbiter cap defaults were raised to new baseline values (`src/arbiter.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `src/sessionband.rs`, `src/evcurve.rs`, `src/evsnipe.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - arbiter global default changed to `EVPOLY_ARB_GLOBAL_MAX_USD=100000` in code; `.env.full.example` arbiter guidance now reflects `100000`.
  - arbiter per-strategy `.env.full.example` caps raised for `sessionband_v1` and `evsnipe_v1`:
    - `EVPOLY_ARB_STRAT_SESSIONBAND_MAX_USD=10000`
    - `EVPOLY_ARB_STRAT_EVSNIPE_MAX_USD=10000`
  - strategy cap defaults changed in code:
    - `endgame_sweep_v1`: `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_PER_PERIOD_CAP_USD` default `250 -> 10000`
    - `sessionband_v1`: `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_STRATEGY_CAP_USD` default `2000 -> 10000`
    - `evcurve_v1` D1: `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_D1_STRATEGY_CAP_USD` default `5000 -> 10000`
    - `evsnipe_v1`: `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_STRATEGY_CAP_USD` default `2000 -> 10000`
    - `mm_rewards_v1`: `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_RANK_BUDGET_USD` default `2000 -> 5000`
  - `.env.full.example` was aligned to these defaults (endgame per-period cap, EVcurve D1 cap, SessionBand cap, EVSnipe cap, MM auto rank budget).

- `sessionband_v1` checkpoint schedule is now hardcoded to two alpha trigger points only (`src/main.rs`):
  - strategy evaluates checkpoint eligibility only for `tau_sec=2` and `tau_sec=1` (all other second-level checkpoints are ignored).
  - remote alpha request timing is now aligned to pre-trigger offsets before close: `2050ms` (`tau=2`) and `1050ms` (`tau=1`), with a small hardcoded grace window to tolerate poll jitter.
  - checkpoint dedupe now uses per-period checkpoint IDs (`tau=2` / `tau=1`) instead of generic per-second dedupe.
  - affects `sessionband_v1` across configured symbols/timeframes (`5m/15m/1h/4h`) by reducing decision calls to exactly two late-window checkpoints per period.

- `evcurve_v1` + `sessionband_v1` local plan markdown dependency removed from runtime and repository (`src/main.rs`, `src/plan3_tables.rs`, `docs/`):
  - EVcurve startup no longer loads `docs/plan3.md` or `docs/plandaily.md`; it now boots with `Plan3Tables::empty_for_remote()` and a disabled local D1 table path, keeping decisioning remote-alpha driven.
  - SessionBand startup no longer loads/derives local watch-starts from `docs/plan4b.md`; SessionBand loop now runs without local plan-table initialization and uses remote alpha decisions directly.
  - deleted strategy plan docs: `docs/plan3.md`, `docs/plandaily.md`, `docs/plan4b.md`.
  - affects EVcurve/SessionBand across their configured symbol/timeframe universes by removing local-plan startup requirements.

- `premarket_v1` market discovery is now aligned to shared remote-first discovery flow (`src/main.rs`):
  - premarket now resolves markets via `discover_market_for_timeframe_once(...)` (same path as `endgame_sweep_v1`) instead of the dedicated retry loop in `discover_market_for_timeframe(...)`.
  - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MARKET_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK` env parsing was removed from runtime config and fallback is now hardcoded `true` for shared timeframe discovery.
  - affects premarket timeframe discovery behavior across configured symbols/timeframes (`5m/15m/1h/4h`).

- `evsnipe_v1` discovery is now strictly remote-only with no local fallback branch (`src/evsnipe.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - removed runtime fallback gating/env usage (`EVPOLY_REMOTE_EVSNIPE_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK`) and removed local Gamma paging fallback from `refresh_hit_market_specs(...)`.
  - EVSnipe now fails closed when remote discovery is not configured or returns no data.
  - `.env.full.example` removed both fallback keys:
    - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MARKET_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK`
    - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_EVSNIPE_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK`

- `mm_rewards_v1` market mode code default changed from `target` to `auto` (`src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - `MmMarketMode::from_env(None)` now resolves to `Auto`.
  - `target`, unknown, and unset values now all resolve to `auto` (`auto` / `hybrid` remain explicit).
  - affects MM rewards market discovery routing when `EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_MODE` is unset.

- `mm_rewards_v1` market discovery path was simplified to remove symbol/timeframe target routing (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env.full.example`, `.env.example`):
  - removed MM mode target env/config parsing and runtime usage (`EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_TARGET`, `EVPOLY_MM_TARGET_QUIET_STACK`, `EVPOLY_MM_TARGET_TAIL_BIASED`, `EVPOLY_MM_TARGET_SPIKE`, `EVPOLY_MM_TARGET_SPORTS_PREGAME`).
  - MM no longer uses shared remote timeframe discovery in its work loop; MM discovery is now local rewards auto-scan only.
  - `EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_MODE=auto` now means local auto rewards discovery only; `EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_MODE=hybrid` adds only `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUGS` selectors.
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` across enabled modes (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`) for all symbols/timeframes inferred from selected reward markets.

- `endgame_sweep_v1` hard guards/defaults tightened for alpha-dependent runtime (`src/main.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - near-base proxy skip gate is now mandatory in endgame (no env switch); `endgame_skip_near_base_proxy_bps` always applies when distance is below `EVPOLY_NEAR_BASE_SKIP_BPS`.
  - thin-flip guard path is now default-off with no env surface (`thin_flip_guard_enable=false`, `guard_v3_enable=false` hardcoded in config parser), and thin-flip env keys were removed from env templates.
  - remote alpha client timeout is now fixed at `1000ms` for all alpha decision/policy callers (`premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`); per-strategy alpha-timeout env keys were removed from env templates where present.

- Global symbol enable defaults now include `BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP` unless env overrides (`src/config.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - changed `Config::default().trading.enable_solana_trading` and `enable_xrp_trading` from `false` to `true`.
  - keeps env override behavior unchanged (`POLY_ENABLE_ETH_TRADING`, `POLY_ENABLE_SOLANA_TRADING`, `POLY_ENABLE_XRP_TRADING` still take precedence when set).
  - affects all strategy paths that use global trading symbol enables, including `premarket_v1` asset fanout and shared market discovery used by multi-strategy runtime loops.

- `evcurve_v1` timeframe/checkpoint surface tightened (`src/evcurve.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - removed `5m` from EVcurve timeframe parsing (no env path can enable EVcurve `5m` now).
  - EVcurve default timeframes are now `15m,1h,4h,1d` (symbols remain `BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP` by default; env can override symbol/timeframe list, except `5m` stays unsupported).
  - hardcoded 15m checkpoints are now exactly `300,240,180` seconds (`T-5/T-4/T-3`); removed the old `T-120` toggle/env control (`EVPOLY_EVCURVE_15M_DISABLE_T3`).

- `evcurve_v1` 4h/1d base-anchor hardening ported from `Poly-builder@417e003` (`src/main.rs`, `src/api.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - expanded `ws_mid_carry_forward` anchor fallback from `15m`-only to non-`15m` EVcurve timeframes (notably `4h`/`1d`) when a prior-period carry value is available at period open.
  - replaced one-shot REST exact-open anchor failure behavior with retry scheduling (`evcurve_base_anchor_rest_retry`) using `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_BASE_ANCHOR_REST_RETRY_MS` (default `2000`ms), so missing REST anchor doesn’t permanently skip the period immediately.
  - enabled Coinbase open/close composition for `1d` timeframe by mapping daily proxy fetch granularity to `1h` buckets in `fetch_coinbase_open_close(...)`.

- Unified bot-side size policy across `premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, and `sessionband_v1` (excluding `evsnipe_v1` and `mm_rewards_v1`) (`src/size_policy.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/endgame_sweep.rs`, `src/evcurve.rs`, `src/sessionband.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - added per-strategy base-size env keys with blank-default behavior (`100` USD fallback): `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_BASE_SIZE_USD`, `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_BASE_SIZE_USD`, `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_BASE_SIZE_USD`, `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_BASE_SIZE_USD`.
  - symbol sizing now follows shared policy: `BTC=1.0`, `ETH=0.8`, `SOL/XRP=0.5`.
  - `premarket_v1` timeframe sizing now hardcodes `5m=0.75`, `15m=1.0`, `1h/4h=1.25` (applies across default symbols `BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP`, env universe overrides still apply).
  - `evcurve_v1` default sizing now uses policy multipliers `15m=0.75`, `1h=1.0`, `4h/1d=1.25`; removed fixed D1 size path from runtime sizing.
  - `endgame_sweep_v1` sizing now uses hardcoded tick split on alpha tick index: `tick0(t-3000ms)=20%`, `tick1(t-1000ms)=40%`, `tick2(t-100ms)=40%` of symbol-scaled base size.
  - `sessionband_v1` sizing now uses hardcoded tau split: `tau=2 -> 30%`, `tau=1 -> 70%`; non-`tau(2|1)` checkpoints do not produce a size.
  - SessionBand remote alpha contract no longer carries sizing (`target_size_usd` removed from alpha response payload); bot sizing remains local-authoritative.

### 2026-03-13

- `premarket_v1` now supports remote alpha yes/no gating before market discovery (`src/main.rs`):
  - added remote premarket alpha client path (`EVPOLY_REMOTE_PREMARKET_ALPHA_URL`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_PREMARKET_ALPHA_TOKEN`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_PREMARKET_ALPHA_TIMEOUT_MS`) as a mandatory gate before discovery/ladder build.
  - each scheduled premarket asset intent now always calls alpha first; `should_trade=false` records explicit skip (`premarket_alpha_no_trade`) and logs `remote_premarket_alpha_hit` / `premarket_alpha_skip`.
  - remote connection/timeout failures now hard-fallback to local 50/50 gate (`premarket_alpha_fallback_local`) with no env switch; non-network alpha failures remain fail-closed (`premarket_alpha_unavailable`).
  - affects `5m/15m/1h/4h` premarket flows across enabled symbols (`BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP`).

- `endgame_sweep_v1` timing/stale edge is now alpha-policy driven (`src/main.rs`):
  - added remote endgame policy client path (`EVPOLY_REMOTE_ENDGAME_ALPHA_URL`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_ENDGAME_ALPHA_TOKEN`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_ENDGAME_ALPHA_TIMEOUT_MS`) with required-mode control (`EVPOLY_ENDGAME_ALPHA_REQUIRED`, default true).
  - strategy now fetches one alpha policy at `t-60s` per `(symbol,timeframe,period)`; policy provides `tick_offsets_ms` and per-period `submit_proxy_max_age_ms`.
  - endgame tick deadlines now use alpha offsets (local jitter removed from scheduler path), and arbiter submit-time stale guard now uses per-request override from alpha policy.
  - added telemetry: `endgame_alpha_policy_requested`, `endgame_alpha_policy_received`, `endgame_alpha_policy_missing`, `endgame_alpha_tick_executed`, `endgame_alpha_stale_guard_blocked`.

- `endgame_sweep_v1` default universe widened in config parser/runtime defaults (`src/config.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - default `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_SYMBOLS` now `BTC,ETH,SOL,XRP`.
  - default `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_TIMEFRAMES` (and invalid-input fallback) now `5m,15m,1h,4h`.

- Alpha service now exposes premarket/endgame alpha endpoints with shared-token + proxy-wallet gating (`src/bin/alpha_service.rs`):
  - new routes: `POST /v1/alpha/premarket/should-trade`, `POST /v1/alpha/endgame/policy`.
  - premarket returns random gate decisions with configurable yes-probability range (`ALPHA_PREMARKET_YES_MIN`, `ALPHA_PREMARKET_YES_MAX`).
  - endgame returns randomized policy around base offsets/stale guard (`ALPHA_ENDGAME_BASE_OFFSETS_MS`, `ALPHA_ENDGAME_OFFSET_JITTER_MS`, `ALPHA_ENDGAME_SUBMIT_PROXY_MAX_AGE_BASE_MS`, `ALPHA_ENDGAME_SUBMIT_PROXY_MAX_AGE_JITTER_MS`).
  - optional proxy-wallet allowlist added via `ALPHA_ALLOWED_PROXY_WALLETS`; request wallet/header mismatch is rejected.

### 2026-03-12

- `evcurve_v1` + `sessionband_v1` alpha dependency is now strictly remote-only (`src/main.rs`):
  - removed local alpha fallback behavior for EVcurve checkpoint decisions (including chase/recheck path) and SessionBand decision evaluation; when remote alpha is missing or unavailable, strategy emits explicit remote-skip outcomes instead of local model decisions.
  - removed `EVPOLY_REMOTE_EVCURVE_ALPHA_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK` / `EVPOLY_REMOTE_SESSIONBAND_ALPHA_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK` runtime usage from remote alpha config path.
  - affects all configured symbols/timeframes for both strategies (`5m/15m/1h/4h`, plus EVcurve `1d`) by making signal generation dependent on remote alpha responses.

- `mm_rewards_v1` market selection filters extended with competition gate + keyword blacklist (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - added `EVPOLY_MM_COMPETITION_LEVEL_ALLOWLIST` (`low,medium,high,unknown`, plus `all/*`) to skip markets whose competition bucket is not allowed.
  - added `EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_BLACKLIST_KEYWORDS` (comma-separated, case-insensitive) to skip markets when slug/question/description matches blocked terms.
  - affects MM rewards candidate admission across all runtime modes (`auto`, `single`, `target`, `hybrid`) before quoting/entry.

- `remote market discovery` local fallback default changed to enabled (`src/main.rs`, `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `scripts/remote_onboard.py`, `README.md`):
  - runtime code default for `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MARKET_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK` remains/now enforced as `true`.
  - onboarding helper now writes market and EVSnipe fallback flags independently, with market fallback defaulting to `true` unless API runtime config overrides it.
  - affects timeframe market discovery used by shared strategy loops (`premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, and `mm_rewards_v1` target/hybrid discovery path) by defaulting to local discovery fallback when remote timeframe discovery is configured but unavailable.

- `premarket_v1` active cap default increased for multi-asset ladder throughput (`.env`, `.env.full.example`):
  - `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_ACTIVE_CAP_PER_ASSET` changed from `24` to `100`.
  - Affects premarket worker admission gate across `5m/15m/1h/4h` by allowing larger concurrent per-asset ladder batches before `entry_invariant_blocked` suppression.

- `poly-oss` parity sync with `poly-remote` for live strategy behavior (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/api.rs`, `src/bin/alpha_service.rs`, `src/bot_admin.rs`, `src/lib.rs`):
  - aligned remote decision wrappers for `evcurve_v1` and `sessionband_v1` so decision payloads and remote alpha response handling match poly-remote execution flow.
  - aligned MM rewards discovery path to rewards-API adaptive candidate pooling (`get_rewards_markets_api` + scanner-side shortlist enrichment), reducing heavy full-universe scans while keeping ranking parity behavior.
  - aligned order submit behavior for primary signer path with post-time retry/backoff and FAK/FOK notional precision guard on BUY market orders, affecting shared entry submit reliability across `premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, and `mm_rewards_v1`.
  - aligned alpha service discovery to scheduler-driven cached snapshots (timeframe + evsnipe + MM rewards snapshots), making discovery endpoints cache-first instead of request-inline scans.
  - enabled `/bot/*` API surface in OSS runtime by including `bot_admin` module wiring in `lib.rs` and route handlers in `main.rs`.

- `order attribution` runtime signer endpoint is now env-driven with HTTPS default (`src/api.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - primary `/order` signer default changed from hardcoded `http://45.76.35.46:8788/sign/order` to `https://signer.evplus.ai/sign/order`.
  - new env overrides:
    - `EVPOLY_ORDER_SIGNER_PRIMARY_URL` (default `https://signer.evplus.ai/sign/order`)
    - `EVPOLY_ORDER_SIGNER_PRIMARY_TOKEN` (optional bearer token for primary signer only)
    - `EVPOLY_ORDER_SIGNER_FALLBACK_URL` (optional, default existing AWS `/sign/order`)
    - `EVPOLY_SUBMIT_SIGNER_URL` (optional, default existing AWS `/sign/submit`)
  - affects entry submit path behavior for all strategies that route through shared order posting (`premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, `mm_rewards_v1`) by switching default primary signer transport to HTTPS and enabling optional primary signer auth without changing strategy decision logic.

- `remote discovery` onboarding/runtime defaults updated for VPS-hosted alpha endpoints (`scripts/remote_onboard.py`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`, `README.md`, `aws/lambda/evpoly-builder-signer/lambda_function.py`):
  - onboarding helper now auto-writes signer + discovery runtime keys (URLs/timeouts/fallback flags) into env files after `/onboard/finish`.
  - default discovery URLs now target `https://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/discovery/timeframe` and `https://alpha.evplus.ai/v1/discovery/evsnipe`.
  - default remote discovery mode now sets `EVPOLY_REMOTE_*_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK=false` in templates/onboard writes, making discovery VPS-dependent by default unless explicitly overridden.
  - onboarding API now supports optional runtime bootstrap payload (order signer URL, alpha base/discovery URLs, optional shared discovery/signer tokens) so users can onboard with fewer manual env edits.

### 2026-03-11

- strategy surface cleanup removed legacy strategy/runtime paths:
  - removed strategy implementations/modules and runtime loops for `reactive_v1`, `liqaccum_v1`, `snapback_v1_1`, and `endgame_revert_v1`.
  - removed associated entry execution modes, worker lanes, and strategy-specific submit/cancel/reporting branches in `src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `src/config.rs`, and `src/arbiter.rs`.
  - detached `endgame_sweep_v1` from reactive-bias dependency so it runs on deterministic retained inputs only.
  - removed learning/adaptive runtime loop wiring and retired removed-strategy env/config surfaces from `.env` and `.env.full.example`.
  - introduced neutral entry tuning keys (`EVPOLY_ENTRY_*`) for detector entry gates/buffers in place of removed reactive-prefixed keys.

- `redemption` `/positions` pre-scan reliability hardening (`src/api.rs`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - wallet redeemable-position fetch now retries with bounded exponential backoff before failing (`EVPOLY_WALLET_POSITIONS_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `EVPOLY_WALLET_POSITIONS_RETRY_BASE_MS`).
  - `/positions` response handling now reads bytes and includes bounded body preview in error context to preserve parse/transport diagnostics.
  - redemption pre-scan warning now logs the full anyhow chain and applies cooldown suppression (`EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_POSITIONS_WARNING_COOLDOWN_SEC`) to reduce repeated noise during transient upstream/API failures.
  - affects global redemption sweep maintenance (all strategy inventories routed through trader redemption logic).

- `manual_premarket_v1` + `manual_chase_limit_v1` runtime entry modules added via admin API (`src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - new admin endpoints:
    - `POST /admin/manual/premarket`
    - `POST /admin/manual/chase-limit`
  - both paths submit through `Trader::execute_limit_buy(...)` (same live order post path as other strategies), preserving remote signer builder attribution on order posts.

- `manual_premarket_v1` pre-open ladder behavior (manual trigger) now uses fixed `5m` cancel policy regardless of market domain (`src/main.rs`):
  - manual premarket resolves market by `condition_id` or `market_slug` and supports explicit token IDs for non-crypto binaries.
  - ladder submits use deterministic fixed-rung sizing (`build_premarket_fixed_rungs(...)`) and schedule staged cancels from `premarket_cancel_stages_for_timeframe(Timeframe::M5)`.
  - staged cancel now uses token-scope filtered cancel (`cancel_pending_orders_for_scope_filtered`) with optional price filters to avoid broad symbol-family cancels.

- `manual_chase_limit_v1` chase-limit runtime loop added (`src/main.rs`):
  - request requires `min_price`, `max_price`, `duration_min`, and `size_usd`.
  - chase repricing cadence defaults from global chase env (`AdaptiveChaseConfig::from_env()`), using `fallback_tick_ms` / `min_replace_interval_ms` unless `poll_ms` is provided.
  - default submit mode is post-only (`manual_chase_limit_v1`); normal maker-off mode is available via `manual_chase_limit_taker_v1`.

- post-only defaults for manual strategy IDs added in trader submit policy (`src/trader.rs`):
  - strategy IDs:
    - `manual_premarket_v1`, `manual_premarket_taker_v1`
    - `manual_chase_limit_v1`, `manual_chase_limit_taker_v1`
  - new strategy-scoped env aliases:
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_POST_ONLY_MANUAL_PREMARKET`
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_POST_ONLY_MANUAL_PREMARKET_TAKER`
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_POST_ONLY_MANUAL_CHASE`
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_POST_ONLY_MANUAL_CHASE_TAKER`

- `entry precheck` market-constraints and submit-scope load hardening (`src/api.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `.env`, `.env.full.example`):
  - market-constraint fetch (`/markets/{condition_id}`) now uses readonly proxy-fallback path plus bounded retry/backoff (`EVPOLY_MARKET_CONSTRAINTS_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, `EVPOLY_MARKET_CONSTRAINTS_RETRY_BASE_MS`) to reduce direct CLOB 429/noisy precheck failures.
  - arbiter submit-scope historical count DB lookup is now skipped when the submit cap is effectively disabled (`usize::MAX`, e.g. `mm_rewards_v1`), removing unnecessary per-request DB reads without changing cap behavior.
  - added targeted hot-path indexes for submit-scope and pending-order existence/lookups to reduce lock hold/wait under MM burst load.
  - affects entry execution/precheck stability across strategies, with largest runtime impact on `mm_rewards_v1`.

### 2026-03-10

- `market discovery` can now be routed to VPS-hosted remote endpoints with optional hard dependency gates (`src/main.rs`, `src/evsnipe.rs`, `.env.example`, `.env.full.example`):
  - timeframe market lookup path (`discover_market_for_timeframe_once`) now supports remote discovery for shared strategy loops that consume this path (`premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `liqaccum_v1`, `mm_rewards_v1` helper lookups), with strict slug/open-ts validation before acceptance.
  - EVSnipe market-spec refresh now supports a remote spec source before local Gamma scanning, with the same optional local-fallback policy.
  - new env controls:
    - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MARKET_DISCOVERY_URL`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MARKET_DISCOVERY_TOKEN`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MARKET_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_MARKET_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK`
    - `EVPOLY_REMOTE_EVSNIPE_DISCOVERY_URL`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_EVSNIPE_DISCOVERY_TOKEN`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_EVSNIPE_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `EVPOLY_REMOTE_EVSNIPE_DISCOVERY_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK`
  - when `*_ALLOW_LOCAL_FALLBACK=false`, discovery becomes VPS-dependent and local fallback is blocked.

- `order attribution` signer routing now falls back to AWS only on timeout-class failures (`src/api.rs`):
  - single-order and batch-order post paths now keep primary errors local unless they are timeout-like.
  - market-order submit path now switches to AWS fallback only for timeout-class primary signer errors.
  - hardcoded signer endpoints are unchanged; this changes entry execution behavior for all live strategies by preventing non-timeout primary errors (for example 4xx no-fill) from auto-rerouting to AWS.

- `order attribution` fallback classifier broadened to transient infra errors while keeping rate limits on primary (`src/api.rs`):
  - AWS fallback now triggers on timeout/network/server-transient classes (timeouts, connection failures, 5xx).
  - `429`/rate-limit errors explicitly do not trigger AWS fallback; callers stay on primary and use existing backoff/retry flow.
  - affects all order submit paths (single, batch, market-order) and keeps business/validation 4xx local to primary.

- `redemption` adaptive trigger default is now enabled by default (`src/trader.rs`, `.env`, `.env.full.example`):
  - `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_ADAPTIVE_ENABLE` fallback changed from `false` to `true` in code.
  - runtime/example env now explicitly set `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_ADAPTIVE_ENABLE=true`.
  - affects global redemption sweep behavior across all strategies/timeframes by allowing balance-ratio and pending-count adaptive triggering without requiring explicit env opt-in.

### 2026-03-09

- `redemption` claim sweep tightened to strict API-only candidate gating (`src/trader.rs`):
  - DB restore path is now explicitly bypassed for redemption submit eligibility, even if restore env is set.
  - adaptive pending trigger now uses live API redeemable-condition count only.
  - pending-trade winner rows are redeemed only when their condition is currently present in API redeemable set; otherwise they stay pending with `waiting_api_redeemable_winner`.
  - losing rows remain `not_required` (no loser redeem submit).
  - affects all strategies routed through trader redemption maintenance.

- `redemption` API-direct submits now batch by condition (default chunk 10) to reduce relayer credit consumption (`src/trader.rs`, existing env):
  - API-direct winner claims now use `redeem_tokens_batch(...)` when `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_BATCH_SUBMIT_ENABLE=true`.
  - batch chunk size is controlled by `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_BATCH_CONDITIONS_PER_REQUEST` and capped by per-sweep max.
  - one-by-one direct redeem remains as fallback when batch submit is disabled.
  - telemetry now tags API-direct submits with `batch_submit` and `batch_size`.

- `redemption` + `merge` submit mode hard-pinned to batch (2026-03-09, `src/trader.rs`, `src/api.rs`):
  - redemption submit path is now batch-only (no one-by-one fallback) for both API-direct winners and pending winner queues.
  - redemption batch chunk is hardcoded to `10` conditions per relayer request.
  - added `merge_complete_sets_batch(...)` in API and switched merge sweeps/manual merge submit to batch-call path.
  - merge sweep now sends chunked relayer batch calls (hardcoded `10` conditions per request) and logs `batch_submit` / `batch_size`.

- `redemption` + `merge` sweep trigger policy updated to adaptive-first mode (`src/trader.rs`, `.env`):
  - added explicit schedule toggles:
    - `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_SCHEDULE_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MERGE_SCHEDULE_ENABLE`
  - added adaptive trigger gates for both sweep paths:
    - pending-count threshold OR low available-balance ratio (`available_usdc / estimated_portfolio`)
    - cooldown-enforced run slots (`EVPOLY_*_ADAPTIVE_COOLDOWN_SEC`, set to 15m in runtime env).
  - runtime env now enables adaptive sweeps and disables hourly scheduled intervals by default.
  - merge adaptive trigger has a hard gate: it runs only when `EVPOLY_STRATEGY_MM_REWARDS_ENABLE=true`; manual/scheduled merge behavior remains unchanged.
  - affects global post-settlement ops flow (all symbols/timeframes) via trader redemption/merge maintenance loop.

- `redemption` claim path switched to API-first verification and winner-only submit focus (`src/trader.rs`, `.env`):
  - adaptive redemption pending trigger now uses in-memory unsold count (no DB candidate query dependency).
  - optional DB restore for redemption candidates is now gated by `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_RESTORE_PENDING_FROM_DB_ENABLE` (default runtime `false`).
  - added API direct redeemable scan (`/positions`) pass before pending-trade loop; condition-level redeem submits now come from live `redeemable=true` wallet positions (winner-only path).
  - per-candidate flow now checks live API token balance first; zero-balance rows are cleared as `already_redeemed` before market-result/redeem logic.
  - submit path remains winner-only (`token_winner`); losing tokens are marked `not_required` and no redeem submit is attempted.
  - affects all strategy positions routed through trader redemption maintenance.

- `mm_rewards_v1` anti-pickoff upgrade for pump/dump conditions (`src/mm/fair_mid.rs`, `src/mm/metrics.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env`, `.env.full.example`):
  - added new fair-mid module using microprice-style side reference and asymmetric speed limiter (`up_step_bps` slow, `down_step_bps` fast) to avoid over-chasing upward spikes.
  - wired fair-mid cap into normal ladder quoting so top BUY rung is clipped to a fair-mid-derived ceiling (`EVPOLY_MM_FAIR_MID_*`).
  - extended toxicity trigger with thin-depth detection (`latest top depth vs rolling p20`) and preserved existing cancel+pause+reentry flow.
  - added forced inventory-exit BUY floor gate: in forced counter-ladder mode, BUY quoting is blocked (and existing forced BUYs canceled) when top reference price is `<= EVPOLY_MM_FORCE_BUY_MIN_PRICE` (default `0.10`).
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` across all MM symbols/timeframes using the shared MM runtime loop; `competition_high_freeze` behavior unchanged (still env-controlled and currently disabled in runtime config).

- `premarket_v1` + `mm_rewards_v1` now use true Polymarket `POST /orders` batch placement on the live submit path (`src/trader.rs`, `src/api.rs`):
  - added a trader-side micro-batcher that aggregates eligible order submits for a short flush window and submits them via one API batch call.
  - route scope:
    - `premarket_v1` ladder entries (`strategy_id=premarket_v1`, `entry_mode=ladder`)
    - `mm_rewards_v1` entries (`strategy_id=mm_rewards_v1`, `entry_mode=mm_rewards/ladder`)
  - non-eligible strategies keep the existing single-order submit path unchanged.
  - batch worker includes safe single-order fallback if batch call fails at transport level.
  - per-order success/failure from batch response is preserved and propagated back to execution logic.
  - new env controls:
    - `EVPOLY_BATCH_PLACE_ENABLE` (default `true`)
    - `EVPOLY_BATCH_PLACE_MAX_ORDERS` (default `10`, capped to API max `15`)
    - `EVPOLY_BATCH_PLACE_FLUSH_MS` (default `8`)
    - `EVPOLY_BATCH_PLACE_QUEUE_CAP` (default `2048`)

### 2026-03-08

- `evcurve_v1` + `sessionband_v1` 15m Coinbase base-anchor source changed to trade carry-forward with sequence-gap guard (`src/coinbase_ws.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Coinbase WS trade parsing now captures exchange-time/sequence fields and stores rolling 15m boundary anchors (`period_anchors_15m`) derived as carry-forward base (`last trade <= period open`).
  - 15m anchor selection in both strategy loops now prefers this trade carry-forward anchor (`ws_trade_carry_forward`) before falling back to previous WS-mid exact-open path.
  - Added WS mid carry-forward fallback (`ws_mid_carry_forward`): the latest healthy mid observed before period boundary is carried to the next 15m open when trade-carry anchor is unavailable.
  - If a sequence gap is detected around boundary crossing, 15m anchor is hard-skipped with `skip_reason=sequence_gap_around_open` to avoid polluted base.
  - When WS carry-forward/exact anchor is unavailable, 15m now allows existing REST exact-open fallback path (`rest_exact`) instead of immediate hard-skip.
  - Affects: all four symbols on `15m` for `evcurve_v1` and `sessionband_v1`; improves exact-open robustness during Coinbase WS lag/reconnect bursts.

- `evcurve_v1` + `sessionband_v1` exact 15m base-anchor hardening:
  - Updated `src/main.rs` period base capture path to keep the first proxy tick seen after period open in-memory per `(symbol,timeframe,period_open_ts)`.
  - Added DB `upsert_evcurve_period_base(...)` writes from first-seen WS exact anchors (within `EVPOLY_PROXY_BASE_EXACT_MAX_DELAY_MS`) so later loops/restarts can reuse exact anchors.
  - For `15m`, removed REST candle fallback for base anchoring: if exact DB/WS anchor is unavailable, strategy now skips with `exact_proxy_base_unavailable_ws_or_db` instead of accepting delayed/empty REST.
  - Affects: `evcurve_v1` and `sessionband_v1` 15m checkpoint eligibility and anchor correctness; key path `src/main.rs` base-anchor init blocks in each loop.

- H1 period-mismatch guard fixed for non-BTC symbols:
  - Updated `src/main.rs` `h1_market_slug_matches_target_open_ts(...)` to handle symbol-aware hour slugs (`bitcoin/ethereum/solana/xrp`) instead of BTC-only expected slug logic.
  - Added compatibility for timestamp-style 1h slugs (`*-updown-1h-<open_ts>`) when present.
  - Added/updated tests in `src/main.rs` (`h1_mismatch_blocks_submit_and_emits_event`) to assert ETH + timestamp-style 1h slugs pass when period matches.
  - Affects: all strategies using `h1_market_period_mismatch_for_trade(...)` (`evcurve_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, and other H1 discovery-gated paths).
- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-exit loss-floor basis TTL refresh (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `.env`, `.env.full.example`):
  - added `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_ENTRY_BASIS_TTL_SEC` (default `7200`) to age out stale entry basis used by weak-exit loss-floor pricing.
  - weak-exit now resolves entry basis in this order:
    - all-time BUY-fill basis while age <= TTL,
    - recent BUY-fill basis inside TTL window when stale,
    - live mark fallback (`best_bid/best_ask`) when stale and no recent fills.
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` inventory-exit/weak-exit SELL pricing across all symbols/timeframes/modes; prevents old high-cost basis from pinning exit ladders far above current market for long-held inventory.
  - added runtime telemetry fields on weak-exit events: `entry_basis_source`, `entry_basis_age_ms`, `entry_basis_ttl_ms`, `entry_basis_ttl_expired`.
- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-exit basis rolling-window precedence fix (`src/main.rs`):
  - basis resolution now prefers rolling-window BUY-fill basis (last TTL window) before all-time basis.
  - prevents fresh fills from re-pinning exits to stale high all-time basis when recent-window basis exists.
  - keeps stale all-time fallback behavior unchanged (`mark_fallback_after_ttl` / `stale_all_time_basis`) when no rolling-window basis is available.
  - affects weak-exit SELL pricing in long-held inventory markets.
- `premarket_v1` dispatch and expiry safety update (`src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `.env`):
  - premarket arbiter dispatch now uses true per-market scope lanes (`timeframe + period + condition`) with dedicated channel queues and lifecycle GC (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_SCOPE_LANE_ENABLE`, `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_MAX_SCOPE_LANES`, `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_SCOPE_LANE_IDLE_TTL_SEC`, `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_SCOPE_LANE_QUEUE_CAP`).
  - each scope lane forwards to execution workers independently, so one bursty premarket market no longer blocks the enqueue path for other premarket markets.
  - premarket limit `expiration_ts` is now capped by launch window (`period_open_ts + EVPOLY_PREMARKET_CANCEL_AFTER_OPEN_*`) so late submits cannot remain live far after market open.
  - premarket cancel stage scheduling is now env-driven for post-open offsets and pre-open trims (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_CANCEL_AFTER_OPEN_*`, `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_CANCEL_PREOPEN_TRIM_*_OFFSET_SEC`); `15m` post-open cancel window changed to `+40s`.
  - non-premarket ladder/reacive paths are unchanged by this expiry cap.
- `evsnipe_v1` hit execution upgraded to two-leg trigger flow (`src/main.rs`, `src/evsnipe.rs`, `.env`):
  - pre-hit leg: if Binance trade enters `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_PRE_TRIGGER_BPS` band (default `1bps`) before strike, submit `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_SIZE_USD * EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_PRE_LEG_RATIO` (default `30%`).
  - confirm leg: on actual hit-cross, submit remaining signal size (`total - already reserved`) so one signal totals `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_SIZE_USD` (default now `200 USD`).
  - leg dedupe is now per condition+leg (`pre`/`confirm`) so one market can do at most one pre-leg and one confirm-leg.
  - submit cap remains hardcoded `0.99` for hit path, with existing cross-ask level selection.
  - close/range EVSnipe path remains unchanged.
- `evsnipe_v1` execution isolation + enqueue behavior update (`src/main.rs`):
  - EVSnipe now has its own arbiter execution lane/worker pool (`arbiter_exec_tx_evsnipe`, `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_EVSNIPE`) instead of sharing the normal lane.
  - EVSnipe enqueue is now single-shot (no retry/backoff loop) for both hit and close/range submits, reducing avoidable enqueue latency under burst conditions.
- Runtime memory safety cleanup for `evsnipe_v1` + `mm_rewards_v1` (`src/main.rs`):
  - `evsnipe_v1`: added bounded runtime-state pruning with expiry tracking for condition/leg dedupe sets (`fired_conditions`, `fired_hit_legs`, `reserved_usd_by_condition`) plus periodic telemetry (`evsnipe_state_pruned`, `evsnipe_state_sizes`).
  - `mm_rewards_v1`: fill dedupe keys are now TTL/cap bounded (`mm_fill_seen_event_keys`), rolling action/cancel/fill maps now prune empty keys, and periodic map-size telemetry was added (`mm_rewards_state_sizes`).
  - Removed hard-dead runtime branches by replacing `if false` loop blocks with explicit legacy feature flags:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_LEGACY_ACTIVITY_SYNC_IN_LOOP`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_LEGACY_COMP_REFRESH_IN_LOOP`
  - Affects runtime stability/observability only; no intentional change to strategy entry/exit/sizing decisions.
- `mm_rewards_v1` arbiter budget leak fix for request-id collisions (`src/main.rs`):
  - MM quote `request_id` now includes `condition_id`, `token_id`, and an atomic nonce, eliminating same-millisecond cross-market ID reuse for identical mode/symbol/timeframe/period/side/rung tuples.
  - `ArbiterBudgetLedger::reserve` now detects duplicate `request_id` keys and releases the prior reservation before applying the new one, with `arbiter_budget_request_id_collision_replaced` telemetry.
  - This prevents reservation overwrite/leak behavior that could pin effective arbiter remaining budget near zero and cascade into `mm_floor_min_not_met` BUY starvation.
- `mm_rewards_v1` reward-min target multiplier for true floor scaling (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `.env.full.example`):
  - added `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_TARGET_MULT` (default `1.0`) to scale computed reward-min shares targets after floor policy (`per_rung`/`reference_price`/`hybrid`) and before cap.
  - MM rung sizing and local scoring min-size checks now apply this multiplier consistently, so setting `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_TARGET_MULT=2.0` targets 2x reward-min sizing across MM rung computations.
  - MM auto candidate reward-floor share estimates now use the same multiplier, keeping market ranking expectations aligned with live rung sizing.
  - startup MM config telemetry now prints `reward_min_target_mult` for runtime verification.
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` across all enabled modes/symbols/timeframes (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`).

### 2026-03-07
- `evcurve_v1` + `sessionband_v1` proxy-base anchoring is now strict exact-open with REST fallback (`src/main.rs`, `src/api.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`):
  - period base is accepted only when timestamp is exact-open (delay `<= EVPOLY_PROXY_BASE_EXACT_MAX_DELAY_MS`, default `0ms`).
  - late DB anchors are rejected; late WS anchors are rejected.
  - when exact WS/DB anchor is unavailable, strategy now fetches exact-open from proxy REST:
    - Binance for `1h`
    - Coinbase for other active tfs in these strategies.
  - if REST cannot provide exact-open base, that period is hard-skipped (`*_base_anchor_exact_skip`), no late proxy fallback trading.
  - base persistence now uses overwrite (`set_evcurve_period_base`) so exact REST anchor can replace previously polluted late rows.
  - Coinbase REST exact-open fallback now sends explicit `User-Agent` header to satisfy Coinbase candle endpoint requirements.
- `mm_rewards_v1` forced-inventory deep-bid inside offset (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env`):
  - forced inventory two-way deep bid anchor now applies an inside-border offset (`EVPOLY_MM_FORCED_EXIT_DEEP_BID_INSIDE_OFFSET_CENTS`, default `1.0`) so bids sit 1c inside the rewards spread border instead of exactly on the outer edge.
  - anchor formula changed from `best_bid - reward_range_width` to `best_bid - reward_range_width + inside_offset`, still clamped below best bid by at least one tick.
  - added telemetry fields in `mm_rewards_forced_exit_opposite_deep_ladder`: `inside_offset_cents` and `inside_offset_width`.
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` inventory-exit two-way quote path for inventory-heavy markets (e.g., `MISC/1d` exit ladders).
- Order reconcile + PM WS resilience update (`src/trader.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/polymarket_ws.rs`, `.env`):
  - periodic exchange reconcile now prioritizes active pending orders and retries only a bounded stale/reconcile-failed subset with age/backoff gates:
    - `EVPOLY_ORDER_RECONCILE_RETRY_MAX_ROWS`
    - `EVPOLY_ORDER_RECONCILE_RETRY_MIN_AGE_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_ORDER_RECONCILE_RETRY_MAX_PERIOD_AGE_SEC`
  - repeated status rewrites are suppressed (`pending_orders` status update now no-ops when status is unchanged), reducing DB churn and repeated reconcile loops.
  - known order-lookup misses in periodic/startup/stale-cancel reconciles were downgraded from warn-level to debug-level and keep terminal vs transient classification.
  - PM market WS reconnect now uses unstable-session aware backoff + jitter (`EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_UNSTABLE_WINDOW_SEC`, `EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_RECONNECT_JITTER_MS`) to reduce shard reconnect churn.
  - runtime defaults updated in `.env` (including `EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_SHARDS=4`) for lower per-shard WS lag pressure.
- `mm_rewards_v1` inventory two-way precedence + auto-deselect protection (`src/main.rs`):
  - inventory-forced conditions now take execution precedence over auto/target work items in the per-loop work queue, so inventory-exit behavior is not silently overridden by auto selection.
  - auto-deselect cleanup now skips `cancel_pending_orders_for_strategy_condition` for conditions currently tracked by the inventory janitor, preventing accidental cancellation of active inventory-exit ladders.
  - any market with live inventory and active imbalance now forces inventory-exit mode (even when sourced from auto), keeping two-way inventory exit logic active instead of falling back to heavy-side BUY cancellation.
  - affected path: `mm_rewards_v1` loop orchestration for inventory-bearing markets (notably `MISC/1d` auto + inventory overlap cases).
- `mm_rewards_v1` hourly dust inventory auto-sell (`src/trader.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `scripts/wallet_history_sync.py`, `.env`):
  - added new admin endpoint `POST /admin/mm/dust-sell` that scans MM wallet inventory and submits `SELL` `FAK` market orders for dust-sized positions.
  - dust sweep now forces a fresh CLOB auth before submitting market orders to avoid silent stale-session submit failures during background hourly runs.
  - dust candidates are constrained by wallet size + notional caps and still respect exchange min-order constraints before submit; unsellable below-exchange-min dust is skipped with explicit reasons.
  - wallet sync worker now triggers dust sell once per run (hourly tmux loop), and records dust sell status/candidate/submitted metrics in `wallet_sync_runs_v1`.
  - wallet sync mark persistence now computes book marks first and writes unrealized rows in batched DB statements (instead of per-row write during network I/O), reducing SQLite writer-lock hold time and lock contention with live trading writes.
  - key env controls: `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_ENABLE`, `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_MAX_NOTIONAL_USD`, `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_MAX_SHARES`, `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_SCAN_LIMIT`, `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_MAX_ORDERS`, `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_TIMEOUT_SEC`.
  - runtime env defaults enabled in `.env`: `ENABLE=true`, `MAX_NOTIONAL_USD=30`, `MAX_SHARES=250`, `SCAN_LIMIT=4000`, `MAX_ORDERS=20`, `TIMEOUT_SEC=45`.
- `premarket_v1` arbiter dedupe now preserves multi-rung ladder submits (`src/arbiter.rs`):
  - exact-key dedupe in `Arbiter::resolve_conflicts` now includes a premarket-only variant key derived from rung price (`max_price`), so same token/side rungs do not collapse into one intent.
  - non-premarket strategies keep prior exact-key dedupe behavior unchanged.
  - added tests:
    - `premarket_exact_dedupe_keeps_distinct_rungs`
    - `non_premarket_exact_dedupe_still_blocks_duplicates`
  - impact: prevents `arbiter_dispatch_rejected reason=dedupe_exact_key_lost` from dropping most premarket ladder rungs in a batch.
- `mm_rewards_v1` arbiter floor-aware reservation clamp + MM budget uplift (`src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - raised `EVPOLY_ARB_GLOBAL_MAX_USD` from `14400` to `100000`.
  - arbiter dispatch now treats MM rung `target_size_usd` as a minimum reservation floor and attempts reservation with `max(arbiter_alloc, mm_floor)`.
  - if that floor cannot be reserved, dispatch now drops with `arbiter_dispatch_budget_exhausted` (`reason=mm_floor_min_not_met`) instead of forwarding an undersized MM order.
  - affects `mm_rewards_v1` auto-mode quote flow (primarily `MISC/1d`) by preventing repeated `ENTRY_FAILED precheck:mm_rewards_notional_floor_exceeds_budget` loops from under-allocated intents.
- `mm_rewards_v1` active-sell spread-capture + inventory-exit hardening (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - added force-exit stale-balance fallback controls (`EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_STALE_FALLBACK_*`) so weak-exit SELLs can continue using capped/haircut cached balance instead of hard-stopping on transient live-balance misses.
  - forced-exit ladder now keeps minimum live SELL coverage (`EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_FORCE_MIN_ACTIVE_RUNGS`) and avoids canceling below that floor to reduce cancel-flap and no-order gaps.
  - spread-capture mode now anchors forced weak-exit ladder at/above top ask by default (`EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_SPREAD_CAPTURE_ENABLE`), then ladders upward by ticks.
  - added inventory-only mode activation for dead-capital scopes (forced inventory scope or low-reward + inventory), blocking new BUYs and running exit-only flow until inventory is reduced.
  - `/admin/mm/status` now exposes new live KPIs: `sell_to_buy_fill_usd_pct_24h`, `markets_with_open_sells_when_weak_inventory_gt0`, and weak-exit stale-skip rates (`3h`/`24h`) from event telemetry.
- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-exit floor fix for dead-capital drains (`src/main.rs`):
  - weak-exit SELL min-size checks now use exchange minimum-order notional converted to shares (`minimum_order_size/price`) instead of reward `rewards.min_size` shares.
  - this prevents forced inventory exits from stalling on reward floor values (for example 100-200 share reward targets) when inventory is below that threshold.
  - applied across competition-high exits, dynamic imbalance ladders, and normal weak-side exits; added extra telemetry context (`reward_min_size_shares_hint`) to verify the floor source at runtime.
  - force-exit balance sourcing now treats zero/empty live sellable+balance reads as stale when cached inventory is positive, so fallback sizing can still post exit SELLs (`mm_rewards_weak_exit_live_zero_override`) instead of repeatedly skipping with `effective_weak_inventory_shares=0`.
  - weak-exit source selection now filters non-positive live values before prioritization, so `live_sellable=0` cannot shadow a positive live/cached inventory path.
  - in force-exit mode, weak-exit now selects the maximum positive candidate among `live_sellable`, `live_balance`, and `cached_haircut` (instead of first-hit precedence), preventing tiny/zero live reads from suppressing valid exit sizing.
- `endgame_sweep_v1` and `sessionband_v1` now enforce submit-time proxy freshness in arbiter execution (`src/main.rs`):
  - added request-carried proxy timestamp (`proxy_update_ts_ms`) and decision-age telemetry.
  - submit is hard-blocked when proxy age at submit exceeds configured max (defaults `500ms`):
    - `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_SUBMIT_PROXY_MAX_AGE_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_SUBMIT_PROXY_MAX_AGE_MS`
  - blocked submits emit `entry_submit_proxy_stale_blocked` and do not call trader POST.
- `sessionband_v1` now enforces decision-to-submit timing gap guard (`src/main.rs`):
  - submit is hard-blocked when `decision_to_submit_ms` exceeds default `500ms` via `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_MAX_DECISION_TO_SUBMIT_MS`.
  - blocked submits emit `sessionband_timing_gap_blocked`.
- timing telemetry for all entry paths now includes proxy fields (`src/main.rs`):
  - `proxy_update_ts_ms`, `proxy_age_at_decision_ms`, `proxy_age_at_submit_ms` in `entry_execution_timing`.
- execution fast-lane update for `endgame_sweep_v1` + `sessionband_v1` (`src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - submit path for these two strategies now executes inline in worker (no spawned handoff), and bypasses submit semaphore waiting entirely.
  - worker hot-path DB checks were removed for these two strategies: active-trade count and submit-scope DB cap check are skipped in fast lane.
  - `sessionband_v1` enqueue retry loop (150ms backoff retry) was removed; enqueue is now single-shot fire-and-forget.
  - added per-pool submit concurrency runtime settings:
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_SUBMIT_CONCURRENCY_ENDGAME=16`
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_SUBMIT_CONCURRENCY_SESSIONBAND=16`

### 2026-03-06
- `evsnipe_v1` execution cap behavior changed to fixed submit limit `0.99` for both hit and close/range paths (`src/main.rs`, `src/evsnipe.rs`):
  - removed ask<=max-price gating from EVSnipe ask-level selection; EVSnipe now always selects a cross level from live asks when orderbook is present.
  - EVSnipe requests now submit with hardcoded `max_price=0.99` and `bid_price=0.99` (no dynamic max-buy cap from ask selection).
  - skip reason on empty/invalid ask books is now `evsnipe_skip_book_empty` instead of `evsnipe_skip_ask_above_cap`.
  - affects: `evsnipe_v1` reaction tracking and submission behavior for all supported market families.

### 2026-03-06
- `mm_rewards_v1` startup stale-order reset + runtime stale-order hardening (`src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - startup `cancel_all_orders()` is now hard-forced for MM restarts instead of honoring `EVPOLY_STARTUP_CANCEL_ALL_SKIP_IF_MM_REWARDS`.
  - after a successful startup cancel-all, MM now purges local active `pending_orders` rows for `mm_rewards_v1` and clears stale `mm_market_states_v1` rows before startup restore/reconcile trusts local state.
  - generic exchange pending-order reconcile now retries rows previously marked `RECONCILE_FAILED` and converts terminal-like order lookup failures (`404` / `not found` / unknown order) into `STALE` instead of leaving them stuck.
  - MM runtime stale-order full sweep is now enabled by default (`EVPOLY_MM_STALE_PERIODIC_FULL_SWEEP_SEC=60`) with a larger default lookup cap (`EVPOLY_MM_STALE_PERIODIC_FULL_SWEEP_MAX_LOOKUPS=2000`).
  - wallet-backed inventory janitor can now bootstrap `market_slug` from `wallet_positions_live_latest_v1` and defaults wallet-only forced markets to `MISC/1d` when old MM state rows were intentionally purged on startup.
  - MM single-market selector discovery now resolves `event_slug/market_slug` selectors by direct `market_slug` lookup first, avoiding current Gamma event-slug `422` failures from blocking restart recovery.
  - startup tracking DB maintenance passes (`strategy_feature_snapshots` backfill, replay prune, missing `ENTRY_FILL` backfill, settlement PnL reconcile) now run in a background task after `bot_start` and market discovery, instead of blocking MM startup.
  - `auto` mode now sends a fast bootstrap candidate snapshot from rewards-page / Gamma rows before waiting on the slow ranked scan, so restart recovery does not sit empty waiting on the full ranking pass.
  - weak-exit SELL sizing now uses live sellable shares (`min(balance, allowance)`) instead of balance alone, and still refuses to stack a new normal weak exit on top of existing open SELL rows for the same token/scope.
  - merge sweep candidate discovery now seeds directly from raw wallet `mergeable=1` positions in `wallet_positions_live_latest_v1`, not only the MM-scoped wallet inventory view.
  - affects: `mm_rewards_v1` startup stale-order cleanup, stale market-state carryover across restarts, and runtime stale-order convergence while the bot is running.

### 2026-03-06
- `evsnipe_v1` expanded from hit-only to hit + close/range execution (`src/evsnipe.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - added rule parser support for `close_above`, `close_below`, and `close_between` markets (e.g. `ethereum-above-*`, `ethereum-price-*` families) while keeping existing hit-rule support.
  - added Binance 1m kline-close stream ingest and dedicated close-trigger submit path.
  - close/range path now selects YES/NO token based on resolved close condition and submits through existing arbiter/trader FAK execution.
  - added boundary-ambiguity and missing-NO-token skip telemetry for close/range cases.
  - EVSnipe max buy is now fixed at `0.99` in code for all EVSnipe market families (same value used by hit path).
  - affects: `evsnipe_v1` for BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP D1-style price-rule markets.

### 2026-03-06
- `mm_rewards_v1` live status truth + preflight/watchdog/exit hardening (`src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `src/mm/scoring_guard.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `scripts/mm_balance_merge_guard.sh`):
  - `/admin/mm/status` now derives active order counts and side inventory from live wallet/pending-order reads instead of trusting `mm_market_states_v1` snapshot counts as truth.
  - MM scoring guard now uses same-side BBO anchors in the second-stage per-rung validator, matching the earlier ladder-capacity filter.
  - sparse markets can keep partial active ladders with a single valid level when reward-eligible, instead of requiring the full pair-depth minimum before staying active.
  - preflight blockers now keep their real reason (`non_scoring`, `full_ladder_required`, `shares_over_cap`, `below_order_floor`) instead of collapsing everything into `non_scoring_rebalance_only`.
  - watchdog now moves empty-ladder markets into `watchdog` state instead of leaving them as `quoting`.
  - weak-exit SELL sizing now requires fresh live balance, uses DB open SELL rows for reserved inventory, and refreshes sell allowance proactively before submit.
  - tracked low-USDC merge guard default in `scripts/mm_balance_merge_guard.sh` is now `300` instead of relying on a local ignored env override.
  - affects: `mm_rewards_v1` runtime market-state telemetry, ladder persistence policy, weak-exit safety, and local merge-guard ops behavior.

### 2026-03-06
- `mm_rewards_v1` wallet sync worker exact-snapshot + auto-reconcile hardening (`scripts/wallet_history_sync.py`):
  - `wallet_positions_live_latest_v1` is now replaced per sync run for the configured wallet, so positions that disappeared from the live wallet are pruned instead of lingering as stale latest rows.
  - after each successful wallet snapshot/activity/mark refresh, the same worker now immediately calls `/admin/mm/reconcile/inventory` and records reconcile status, repaired row count, repaired shares, and reconcile errors in `wallet_sync_runs_v1`.
  - effect: the tmux wallet sync worker now performs actual live-wallet-to-DB convergence for `mm_rewards_v1` inventory instead of only refreshing staging tables.

### 2026-03-06
- `mm_rewards_v1` merge-accounting, wallet-backed reporting, and toxic re-entry implementation (`src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `scripts/wallet_history_sync.py`, `scripts/mm_inventory_reconcile_worker.sh`, `README.md`, `docs/mm-runtime-runbook.md`):
  - merge success now consumes MM inventory in persistent accounting instead of leaving `positions_v2` stale after successful merges.
  - `positions_v2` open-inventory readers now subtract `inventory_consumed_units`, and wallet-sync unrealized marks honor that same net-unit definition.
  - added inventory-consumption audit tables / drift snapshot plumbing and exposed wallet-backed MM attribution plus per-token drift in `/admin/mm/status`.
  - added `/admin/mm/reconcile/inventory` plus a separate reconcile worker script for periodic wallet-vs-DB repair in both directions:
    - stale excess DB inventory is consumed,
    - missing DB inventory is added back through synthetic `ENTRY_FILL_RECONCILED` accounting.
  - inventory janitor now prefers wallet-backed MM inventory when wallet snapshot tables are available, with DB fallback retained for safety.
  - MM quote loop gained toxic re-entry controls:
    - side-toxic and adverse-BBO triggers now arm hold/probe re-entry state,
    - probe mode deepens/reduces the ladder instead of immediately rejoining old top levels,
    - quote submits now tag `reward_stub` vs `capture` rung buckets,
    - PM last-trade snapshots are consumed as an additional toxic sweep signal.
  - added env/config defaults for toxic re-entry, reward stub, and fee-enabled dynamic checks in `MmRewardsConfig`.
  - runtime sizing change in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_SHARES_PER_SIDE` changed from `200` to `1`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REFILL_SHARES_PER_FILL` changed from `200` to `1`
    - effect: active MM ladder sizing now falls through to the live market reward-min floor instead of using a fixed `200` share base.
  - startup/runtime ops hardening:
    - admin API startup was moved earlier so local MM reconcile tooling can reach the bot during heavy startup bootstrap instead of waiting for later restore phases,
    - reconcile worker now logs explicit `admin_unavailable` warnings on startup races,
    - wallet-under-DB reconcile add-path is now idempotent on repeated runs.
  - merge sweep behavior change:
    - merge candidate discovery now unions in-memory MM pending inventory with wallet-backed inventory rows, so sweep can see mergeable complete sets beyond the current pending-trade set.
    - `EVPOLY_MERGE_MAX_CONDITIONS_PER_SWEEP=0` is now treated as unlimited, and the code default was changed from `10` to `0`.
    - effect: one sweep pass can submit all discovered mergeable conditions instead of truncating to the top 10 by pair size.
  - local ops env change in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_BALANCE_GUARD_MIN_USDC` reduced from `1000` to `300`.
    - effect: low-USDC merge-guard manual sweeps now trigger only when available USDC drops below `300`.
  - MM competition fallback hardening (`src/main.rs`):
    - when auto-candidate competition and rewards-page competition caches are both missing, MM now falls back to `market.competitive` from the live market payload instead of leaving competition as `unknown`.
    - effect: forced/janitor markets are less likely to quote with `competition_level=unknown`.
  - MM scoring anchor change (`src/main.rs`):
    - local scoring ladder filtering now uses live same-side top of book (`best_bid`, fallback `best_ask`) as the score anchor before falling back to midpoint geometry.
    - effect: a side priced at `79c` with reward spread `3c` and extend `2c` is treated as scoreable down to about `74c`, instead of being forced through midpoint-equivalent spread logic that can over-reject deep-but-still-valid same-side quotes.

### 2026-03-06
- `evcurve_v1` default chase anchor-stop hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - EVcurve chase now records a fixed PM anchor price at trigger start and cancels all open BUY chase orders if the PM price falls `0.20` below that initial anchor.
  - This is default code behavior, not env-gated.
  - Effect example: if chase starts from `0.72`, the chase is hard-stopped at `0.52` or lower instead of continuing to reprice/cancel indefinitely.

### 2026-03-06
- `mm_rewards_v1` toxic-flow fair-reentry design note recorded in `mm-update.md` after rereading merged `Poly-builder` code (`0ac75c4`):
  - documented target behavior for LP-reward farming + spread capture under toxic flow:
    - immediate toxic cancel,
    - hold/recovery window,
    - deeper fair-value re-entry ladder instead of instant top-of-book rejoin,
    - split `reward_stub` vs deeper `capture_ladder`.
  - documented dynamic fee-enabled detection requirement from live market metadata / `/fee-rate` instead of hardcoded timeframe assumptions.
  - identified intended runtime touchpoints for later implementation:
    - side-toxic cancel branch,
    - ladder deepen / size-shaping path,
    - selective ladder reprice / offboard cooldown path in `src/main.rs`.
  - scope: `mm_rewards_v1` across reward markets/timeframes; documentation-only strategy-plan update, no runtime code change yet.

### 2026-03-06
- Shared execution/risk plumbing hardening across live entry strategies (`src/main.rs`, `src/arbiter.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/monitor.rs`, `scripts/rollout_gate.py`):
  - arbiter conflict resolution now preserves input order, which allows dispatcher-side batch arbitration to map results back to the original concurrent requests safely.
  - arbiter dispatcher now batches ready requests and applies admission before worker fanout, instead of re-arbitrating each request in isolation inside workers.
  - added shared in-memory arbiter budget reservations across the live dispatch stream so global / per-strategy / per-timeframe caps are enforced across concurrently running strategies, not only within a single one-request arbiter call.
  - worker execution now consumes dispatcher-approved allocation directly and releases reserved arbiter budget on exit.
  - premarket dispatcher drop-on-full is now explicit (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_DISPATCH_DROP_IF_FULL`, default `false`) instead of default behavior.
  - monitor callback drop-on-backpressure is now explicit (`EVPOLY_MONITOR_DROP_CALLBACK_ON_BACKPRESSURE`, default `false`) instead of default snapshot loss.
  - affects all runtime-routed entry strategies using `ArbiterExecutionRequest`, including `premarket_v1`, `reactive_v1`, `liqaccum_v1`, `snapback_v1_1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `endgame_revert_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, and `mm_rewards_v1`.
- Tracking/risk-gate fixes for fill-aware strategies (`src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `scripts/rollout_gate.py`):
  - fill-count helpers now read deduped entry-fill state from `fills_v2` instead of broken `trade_events.order_id` SQL.
  - EVcurve and MM fill-cap guards no longer fail open on fill-count query errors.
  - avg entry-price helpers now use deduped fill rows, preventing canonical + reconciled double counting.
  - `pending_orders` now carries `filled_at_ms`, and rollout fill parity prefers `filled_at_ms` plus `fills_v2` when present instead of treating `updated_at_ms` as fill time.
  - active pending-order status handling is normalized to include both `PLACED` and legacy `LIVE`.
- Follow-up runtime/ops hardening for local dirty stack promotion (`ev`, `src/evsnipe.rs`, `src/polymarket_ws.rs`, `src/entry_idempotency.rs`, `src/strategy_decider.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - wallet sync sidecar management was wired into `./ev`, but live-mode scoping is now explicit so `./ev start dry` does not auto-start the wallet sync worker.
  - `evsnipe_v1` paged discovery fallback no longer skips the `200..499` range after a first-page small-limit retry.
  - `evsnipe_v1` market expiry parsing now accepts Gamma `endDate` timestamps and date-only `endDateIso` payloads, restoring discovery of active weekly/monthly crypto hit markets.
  - `evsnipe_v1` discovery now scopes Gamma `/events` paging to `tag_slug=crypto`, which brings the current weekly/monthly crypto hit markets into the scan window without raising the global event scan limit.
  - `evsnipe_v1` watchlist discovery is now narrowed by symbol anchor distance:
    - keep only strikes within `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_STRIKE_WINDOW_PCT` (default `10%`) of the current anchor spot,
    - refresh the anchor every `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_ANCHOR_REFRESH_SEC` (default `4h`),
    - or earlier when spot drifts by `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_ANCHOR_DRIFT_REFRESH_PCT` (default `3%`).
  - Polymarket market WS sharding now tracks market connectivity per shard instead of flipping one shared global flag from each shard loop.
  - Polymarket slug fallback discovery now includes `4h` markets so fallback coverage matches active strategy timeframes.
  - EVcurve-specific enqueue dedupe cooldown remains configurable via `EVPOLY_ENTRY_DEDUPE_COOLDOWN_EVCURVE_MS`.
  - `premarket_v1` scheduler-side late-intent guard remains env-backed by `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_ENQUEUE_GUARD_MS`.
  - removed unused MM config surface `max_active_markets_per_mode` from `mm_rewards_v1` config parsing.

### 2026-03-05
- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-exit balance guard hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - force-rebalance weak-exit now requires a fresh live token balance sample before posting new SELL exits (prevents stale cached balance from oversizing exit posts).
  - dynamic and single-order weak-exit submits now refresh token allowance cache + re-read live token balance on `not enough balance/allowance` errors, then back off.
  - weak-exit ladder sizing now uses `weak_balance_shares_for_exit` (live when present) and emits balance-source telemetry fields.
- discovery refresh resiliency for strategy feeds:
  - WS subscription target discovery now falls back to slug-based targets when the active-markets feed is unavailable (`src/polymarket_ws.rs`).
  - `evsnipe_v1` paged market discovery now retries first page with smaller page size and truncates later pages safely on transient fetch failures (`src/evsnipe.rs`).

### 2026-03-05
- `mm_rewards_v1` reward gating + rebalance execution hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - competition/reward snapshot refresh now merges **rewards page + gamma rewards feed** in one pass, and only swaps to new maps when snapshot has usable rows (keeps last-good snapshot on empty/error refresh).
  - added daily reward hint caches (`condition/slug`) and wired gate fallback: if total reward hint is missing/zero, MM now uses daily-rate hint as secondary reward check.
  - `reward_below_min_total` became a **soft gate** for quoting (still logged), while near-expiry remains the hard exit/offboard gate.
- `mm_rewards_v1` market-details rate-limit resilience (`src/main.rs`):
  - `get_market(...)` detail fetch now retries 429/Too-Many-Requests with backoff and uses stale cached detail snapshot when available instead of hard-failing immediately.
- `mm_rewards_v1` imbalance behavior (`src/main.rs`):
  - rebalance-only mode no longer blindly cancels BUYs on both sides; it cancels heavy/blocked side and can keep light-side BUY quoting during active imbalance (except near-expiry exit window).
  - stale market-feed pause no longer hard-stops rebalance cycles; rebalance/exit can continue in stale windows.
- `mm_rewards_v1` stale/feed handling (`src/main.rs`):
  - successful orderbook fetch now refreshes MM market-data freshness timestamp, preventing false stale-pause/offboard loops when WS is quiet but books are fresh.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` reward discovery/ranking and market-feed scope updates (`src/api.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/polymarket_ws.rs`):
  - Gamma reward parsing now captures total-reward/date fields (with aliases) and computes `reward_total_hint(...)` in API layer.
  - MM auto scanner now ranks/filters by total-reward horizon (not raw daily rate), applies near-expiry exit-window filtering, and threads spread-extend into scoring-feasibility estimates.
  - Added token-scoped market-update wait path in Polymarket WS state so MM event-driven wakeups can be scoped to relevant tokens.
  - Expiry/prune sync now includes token-level market timestamp cache cleanup.
  - Net effect: auto MM market selection is less noisy near expiry and better aligned to remaining reward opportunity.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` entry-basis scoping hardening for weak-exit logic (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`):
  - added config flags:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_ENTRY_BASIS_PERIOD_SCOPED` (default `false`)
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_REQUIRE_ENTRY_BASIS` (default `false`)
  - added new DB accessor:
    - `get_entry_fill_avg_price_for_strategy_scope_condition_token(...)`
    - computes BUY entry average by `strategy + timeframe + period_timestamp + condition_id + token_id`.
  - MM weak-exit paths now use a shared avg-entry lookup that can be period-scoped when enabled.
  - when `WEAK_EXIT_REQUIRE_ENTRY_BASIS=true`, weak-exit submits are skipped (with `mm_rewards_weak_exit_skip_missing_entry_basis`) instead of using fallback basis prices.
  - MM MTM/heartbeat entry basis now uses the same scoped lookup path for consistency with weak-exit decisions.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` stale/reprice cleanup hardening (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - added stale reconcile controls:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_STALE_PERIODIC_FULL_SWEEP_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_STALE_PERIODIC_FULL_SWEEP_MAX_LOOKUPS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_STALE_RECONCILE_CONCURRENCY`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_STALE_RECONCILE_API_BUDGET_PER_MIN`
  - stale reconcile now supports periodic full-sweep passes (bounded by max lookups + per-minute API budget) with telemetry:
    - `mm_rewards_stale_reconcile_summary`
    - `mm_rewards_stale_reconcile_full_sweep_truncated`
    - `mm_rewards_stale_reconcile_budget_exhausted`
  - added off-target cancel policy controls:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_OFF_TARGET_CANCEL_MODE=disabled|safe|aggressive`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_OFF_TARGET_CANCEL_MAX_PER_PASS`
  - ladder reprice now applies off-target cancellation by policy mode with per-pass cap, while preserving legacy behavior when mode is `disabled`.
  - heartbeat now includes stale local-row and stale exchange-cancel counters for clearer stale-state attribution.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` submit backpressure safety controls (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - added MM-only enqueue policy:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_ENQUEUE_MODE=await|bounded|try_send`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_ENQUEUE_TIMEOUT_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_QUEUE_PRESSURE_TELEMETRY`
  - MM submit path now uses `enqueue_arbiter_request_mm(...)`:
    - keeps dedupe behavior,
    - can skip rung submit on queue pressure (bounded timeout / try_send full) instead of blocking.
  - added `entry_enqueue_backpressure_skip` telemetry with queue capacity fields and enqueue mode.
  - defaults preserve prior behavior (`await` mode) until explicitly changed.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` reward min-size floor safety controls (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - added configurable reward-floor policy:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_FLOOR_MODE=per_rung|reference_price|hybrid`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_FLOOR_MAX_MULT` (hybrid clamp vs reference floor)
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_SHARES_CAP` (hard cap, `0` disables cap).
  - MM rung sizing and local scoring min-size checks now use the same policy helper (`mm_reward_min_shares_with_policy`), including cap/floor mode.
  - startup telemetry now prints reward-floor mode/mult/cap.
  - effect: prevents deep-rung floor-share blowups on low prices and keeps scoring-vs-submit floor math consistent.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` ladder/BBO sizing hardening for top-of-book depth (`src/main.rs`):
  - `best_bid_ask_sizes_from_orderbook(...)` now aggregates size across all rows at the best bid/ask price level instead of using only the first row.
  - affects BBO1 footprint checks used by MM ladder anchoring/deepen decisions.
  - effect: reduces false “BBO1 too thin” triggers and stabilizes ladder placement when orderbook has multiple rows at the same top price.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` scoring-guard correctness hardening (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/scoring_guard.rs`):
  - fixed min-size scoring unit mismatch by converting scoring min size to shares per side/price using `reward_min_size_unit` before local scoring checks.
  - local scoring now validates midpoint/price/size inputs explicitly (non-finite or invalid values fail closed).
  - enriched scoring telemetry context with:
    - side min-size shares,
    - spread-cap used,
    - spread/size pass flags,
    - structured `scoring_fail_reasons`.
  - effect: fewer false scoring passes in `mm_rewards_v1` when reward min-size is USD-based and when counterpart quote inputs are invalid/stale.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` stale-reconcile existing-key suppression hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - fixed a stale-throttle edge where `existing_keys` used all open pending rows even when only a capped subset was reconciled, which could let unchecked stale rows block valid ladder reposts.
  - added per-scope verified-open cache from recent order-status checks; when open rows exceed stale lookup cap, existing-key dedupe now prefers:
    - top-window rows (recent),
    - freshly checked non-stale rows this pass,
    - recently verified rows still inside TTL.
  - stale rows removed from verified cache immediately; cache clears when scope has no open rows.
  - effect: reduces false `already-covered` suppression from deep stale rows without changing non-MM strategy paths.

- `mm_rewards_v1` event-driven wait narrowed to MM token scope to reduce wake noise from unrelated markets (`src/polymarket_ws.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env`):
  - Added WS token-scoped waiter path: `wait_for_market_update_after_for_tokens(...)`.
  - MM loop now caches active MM token scope and, when enabled, waits only for updates in that scope.
  - Added config/env: `EVPOLY_MM_EVENT_SCOPE_FILTER_ENABLE=true`.
  - Effect: lower MM loop churn under high global WS traffic without changing MM quote logic.

### 2026-03-04
- `premarket_v1` enqueue path changed to true batch enqueue chunks through arbiter dedupe/send (`src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - Replaced per-request parallel task fanout with chunked batch enqueue (`enqueue_arbiter_requests_batch`).
  - Batch path dedupes by shard in bulk, then sends enqueued requests with batch contention telemetry.
  - Added config/env: `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_BATCH_ENQUEUE_CHUNK=24`.
  - Runtime tuning: raised `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_PREMARKET` from `4` -> `8` in `.env`.
  - Effect: reduce enqueue overhead and queue burst pressure for premarket ladders near open.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` reward metric switched from daily-rate to total-reward hint across MM selection/gating/ranking (`src/api.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Added reward-config parsing fields: `total_rewards`, `start_date`, `end_date` (+ aliases for Gamma/Next payloads).
  - Added `RewardsMarketEntry::reward_total_hint(now_ms, market_end_ts_ms)`:
    - uses explicit total when available,
    - otherwise estimates total as `daily_rate * time_to_market_end_days`.
  - Auto-scan + force-include + min-reward filters now use total-reward hint (including `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_FORCE_INCLUDE_REWARD_MIN` and `EVPOLY_MM_MIN_REWARD_RATE_HINT` semantics).
  - MM detail snapshot now stores:
    - `reward_daily_hint`
    - `reward_total_hint` (and legacy `reward_rate_hint` now mirrors total for backward-compatible plumbing/log fields).

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` scoring spread extension for ladder/scoring gates (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - Added config/env: `EVPOLY_MM_SCORING_SPREAD_EXTEND_CENTS` (set to `2.0` in `.env`).
  - MM scoring checks now use `effective_max_spread = market_max_spread + spread_extend` (with proper cents/probability handling) for:
    - auto candidate feasible-level estimation,
    - runtime ladder scoring filter,
    - local q-min scoring guard (`q_min_ready`) preflight.
  - Added telemetry fields in scoring events:
    - `max_spread_effective`
    - `scoring_spread_extend_cents`
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` market selection + scoring-gated quoting behavior across all MM modes/symbols/timeframes.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` auto-market override + competition-aware normal buffer (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`):
  - Added high-reward force-include path above mode cap:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_FORCE_INCLUDE_REWARD_MIN` (default `500`).
  - Force-included markets now run through auto mode with existing min-stay/cooldown/dedupe safety; they are tagged as `market_source=auto_force_reward`.
  - Added competition-level safe buffer ticks for normal/add BUY ladders:
    - low=`EVPOLY_MM_NORMAL_SAFE_BUFFER_TICKS_LOW` (default `1`)
    - medium=`EVPOLY_MM_NORMAL_SAFE_BUFFER_TICKS_MEDIUM` (default `2`)
    - high=`EVPOLY_MM_NORMAL_SAFE_BUFFER_TICKS_HIGH` (default `3`)
  - Buffer is applied only on normal quote path (not rebalance/imbalance unwind path).
  - Added telemetry for force-include reason and effective buffer ticks in auto selection, safe-buffer, and submit context logs.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` normal BUY quote safe-buffer/reprice controls (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - Added normal-path safe buffer so new/add BUY ladders do not quote at BBO top:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_NORMAL_SAFE_BUFFER_ENABLE` (default `true`)
    - `EVPOLY_MM_NORMAL_SAFE_BUFFER_TICKS` (default `1`)
  - Safe buffer applies only to normal entry/add quoting path (BUY ladder), not rebalance/imbalance exit paths.
  - Added forced top-hit reprice behavior for normal BUY orders:
    - if live BUY row sits at top bid, mark for cancel/repost to buffered ladder.
    - new controls:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_NORMAL_TOP_REPRICE_MIN_REST_MS` (default `700`)
      - `EVPOLY_MM_NORMAL_TOP_REPRICE_COOLDOWN_MS` (default `1500`)
  - Added telemetry:
    - `mm_rewards_safe_buffer_applied`
    - enriched `mm_rewards_ladder_reprice_cancel` with `normal_top_hit_rows` and safe-buffer config context.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-exit execution reliability hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - Imbalance ladder exits now size only the **remaining** target (`target_exit_total - open_exit_reserved_shares`) to avoid duplicate oversubmits that caused `not enough balance / allowance`.
  - Added settle-wait behavior after weak-exit reconcile cancels (`mm_rewards_weak_exit_reconcile_settle_wait`) so the same loop does not cancel+repost before cancel state settles.
  - Added post-only sell floor enforcement for weak exits (`sell_price >= best_bid + 2*tick_size`) in both dynamic imbalance ladder and single-order weak-exit paths to reduce `invalid post-only order: order crosses book` rejects.
  - Added weak-exit failure backoff in dynamic ladder path for balance/allowance/insufficient errors, and aborts remaining rung submits on balance/cross-book rejects to prevent burst-fail spam.
- Polymarket WS market-loop lag handling (`src/polymarket_ws.rs`):
  - Added soft lag-error tolerance window (`EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_LAG_SOFT_ERRORS`, `EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_LAG_WINDOW_SEC`) so transient `lagged by ... messages` stream errors do not force immediate reconnect storms.
  - New telemetry `polymarket_ws_market_stream_lag_soft` for lag-rate visibility before hard reconnect.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` Phase-5 market routing/state-priority hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - Added explicit MM dominant-state model with precedence:
    - `stale_pause > rebalance_emergency > rebalance_hard > rebalance_soft > normal_quote`.
  - Rebalance-only state now carries adaptive band context in reason/logs:
    - `imbalance_rebalance_only_{soft|hard|emergency}`.
  - Added dominant-state transition telemetry:
    - `mm_rewards_dominant_state_transition`.
  - Added emergency auto offboard path for `auto` mode:
    - new runtime map `mm_auto_force_offboard_until_ms_by_condition`,
    - bypasses min-stay stickiness when market is force-offboarded.
  - Auto cooldown/rotation now also triggers for non-viable routing cases:
    - `not_reward_eligible`,
    - non-scoring rebalance-only (including full-ladder-required path),
    - stale market-feed pause.
  - Auto scan snapshot now reports:
    - `forced_offboard_skipped_count`,
    - `force_offboard_active_conditions`.
  - MM market runtime state persistence now includes dominant-state tag in `market_mode_runtime` (`source:mode:dominant_state`).
  - Affects `mm_rewards_v1` across all enabled MM modes (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`) and all symbols/timeframes selected by target/auto/hybrid routing.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` Phase-4 event-driven control hardening (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/metrics.rs`):
  - Added two-step stale gate per MM scope (`condition:tf:period:token`):
    - stale hold on early strikes,
    - stale pause + ladder cancel on repeated/prolonged stale,
    - recovery requires configurable healthy streak before resume.
  - Added feed-stale integration (`last_market_event_ms`) into stale strikes/pause behavior.
  - Added side toxicity guard (PM-only microstructure):
    - uses short-horizon returns (250ms/1s), micro-skew (BBO size imbalance), and update-burst,
    - pauses threatened side and cancels in-scope BUY quotes during toxicity pause window.
  - Added action-budget mode (`normal/conserve/survival`) per condition from rolling action pressure:
    - actions/min, cancel/fill ratio, and stale-strike pressure.
    - mode now modulates ladder levels, size multiplier, and deepen ticks.
  - Added diff-state hysteresis upgrades:
    - pending-cancel settle window before repost,
    - separate anchor vs outer min rest cooldowns for reprice.
  - New config/env knobs added for stale gate, toxicity, action-budget, and reprice hysteresis controls.
  - Added MM telemetry events:
    - `mm_rewards_action_mode_transition`,
    - `mm_rewards_stale_hold`,
    - `mm_rewards_toxic_side_pause`,
    - enriched reprice logs with action-mode/pending-cancel context.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` Phase-2 cleanup + Phase-3 escalation update (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - Fixed imbalance exit sizing bug:
    - dynamic rebalance target now uses `weak_balance_shares - safety_buffer` (no longer adds open SELL size and over-targets ladder notional).
  - Competition-freeze exit sizing now supports dynamic sizing + BBO ask liquidity clip (instead of always fixed max-order cap behavior).
  - Added adaptive rebalance bands (`soft/hard/emergency`) using:
    - imbalance ratio,
    - time in imbalance,
    - 1s markout EWMA.
  - Added new MM weak-exit band env controls:
    - hard/emergency thresholds (ratio/time/markout),
    - per-band loss floors,
    - per-band extra deepen ticks,
    - per-band reprice multipliers.
  - Rebalance exit ladder now uses band-driven aggressiveness:
    - adaptive allowed loss floor,
    - deeper/lower sell anchors in hard/emergency,
    - faster reprice cadence in hard/emergency.
  - Extended weak-exit telemetry with band context:
    - `rebalance_band`, `allowed_loss_pct`, `time_in_imbalance_ms`,
      `markout_ewma_1s_bps`, `reprice_mult`, `force_touch_exit`.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` Phase-2 (imbalance-first exit core) update (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - Added dynamic imbalance weak-exit controls:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_DYNAMIC_IMBALANCE_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_IMBALANCE_LADDER_LEVELS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_IMBALANCE_SAFETY_BUFFER_SHARES`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_IMBALANCE_MAX_PCT_OF_BBO_ASK_SIZE`
  - In rebalance imbalance mode, weak-exit now plans a multi-rung SELL ladder from anchor ask, distributes target size across levels, and maintains/cancels/reposts by live open SELL rows in-scope.
  - Exit target size in imbalance mode now tracks live inventory (`wallet + open exit rows`) minus safety buffer, instead of fixed `weak_exit_max_order_shares` clipping.
  - Added liquidity clipping by BBO ask size fraction for each weak-exit rung to avoid oversizing against thin top-of-book.
  - Added telemetry event `mm_rewards_rebalance_exit_ladder_plan` with ladder plan, imbalance ratio, anchor price, and liquidity cap context.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` Phase-1 inventory/PnL state foundation (`src/main.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`):
  - Extended `mm_market_states_v1` with live MM inventory and MTM fields:
    - token IDs, per-side inventory, imbalance side/size, avg entry prices, best bids,
      `mtm_pnl_exit_usd`, `time_in_imbalance_ms`, `max_imbalance_shares`,
      `last_rebalance_duration_ms`, `rebalance_fill_rate`, `exit_slippage_vs_bbo_bps`,
      and `market_mode_runtime`.
  - MM loop now tracks live rebalance lifecycle per condition:
    - starts imbalance timer on threshold breach,
    - records max imbalance during active cycle,
    - emits `mm_rewards_rebalance_cycle_closed` with duration + peak imbalance on recovery.
  - Weak-exit telemetry counters are now tracked in runtime maps and persisted through state snapshots:
    - exit submit/fill counts (for fill-rate),
    - EWMA of exit slippage vs BBO (bps).
  - Final per-market state upsert now writes live inventory/MTM context each loop in live mode.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` Phase-0 hotfix pack (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/mm/metrics.rs`):
  - Fixed duplicate-rung suppression source:
    - `existing_keys` is now built from full open BUY rows (not stale-reconcile subset), so deep stale rows cannot silently block/duplicate ladder submits.
  - Fixed q-min deadlock during skew/risk block:
    - when opposite side is intentionally blocked by skew (`opposite_blocked_by_skew`), scoring preflight now allows side-only scoring for that cycle and emits `mm_rewards_scoring_qmin_bypass`.
  - Wired stale transition telemetry:
    - added stale pause state tracking per MM scope, with transition events:
      - `mm_rewards_stale_pause_entered`
      - `mm_rewards_stale_pause_recovered`
    - `MmMetrics.stale_pauses` now increments on each stale transition via `on_stale_transition`.
  - Added weak-exit SELL TTL maintenance:
    - active MM weak-side SELL exits now enforce TTL (`quote_ttl_ms`) and trigger `mm_rewards_weak_side_exit_ttl_cancel` before replacement.
    - keeps single-live-order behavior with settle grace + replace budget checks.
  - Auto selector fairness + underfill guard:
    - mode selection is now slot-interleaved (round-robin by slot) to avoid mode-order starvation.
    - effective auto pool now enforces a minimum of `enabled_modes * max_active_markets_per_mode` (`auto_top_n_effective`).
  - Config/no-op + data hygiene:
    - explicit startup note that `EVPOLY_MM_PREFILL_DRIFT_RECOVER_BPS` is currently informational-only.
    - removed duplicate `"ncaa"` token in sports slug classifier.

### 2026-03-04
- `premarket_v1` strict late-submit guard + parallel execution isolation (`src/main.rs`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - Added strict premarket late guard in arbiter worker path:
    - blocks any `premarket_v1` ladder request when `now >= period_timestamp` before execution (`premarket_late_guard_blocked` event).
  - Added strict premarket late guard in trader path (`execute_limit_buy`) as fail-safe:
    - rejects premarket ladder submits after market open even if a stale request reaches trader.
  - Added dedicated premarket arbiter queue/pool:
    - new channel + worker pool label `premarket`,
    - new env override `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_PREMARKET` (default `4`),
    - premarket requests no longer share the normal arbiter queue with `mm_rewards_v1/evcurve_v1`.
  - Affects `premarket_v1` across all enabled symbols/timeframes (`5m/15m/1h/4h/1d` ladder mode).

### 2026-03-04
- Strategy execution pool split for true parallel lanes (`src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - Added dedicated arbiter queues/pools for:
    - `endgame_sweep_v1` (`pool=endgame`)
    - `endgame_revert_v1` (`pool=endgame_revert`)
    - `sessionband_v1` (`pool=sessionband`)
    - `evcurve_v1` (`pool=evcurve`)
  - These strategies no longer share `normal`/`critical` execution lanes with each other.
  - Added worker count envs:
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_ENDGAME`
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_ENDGAME_REVERT`
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_SESSIONBAND`
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_EVCURVE`
  - Updated runtime env defaults in `.env` to `4` workers for each new dedicated pool.

### 2026-03-04
- `mm_rewards_v1` risk-cap + merge scheduler reliability update (`.env`, `src/trader.rs`):
  - Raised MM/live exposure caps to avoid ladder submit hard-rejects at `10k`:
    - `POLY_MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_USD: 10000.0 -> 100000.0`
    - `EVPOLY_ARB_STRAT_MM_REWARDS_MAX_USD: 10000 -> 100000`
  - Fixed hourly merge scheduler trigger behavior:
    - `try_claim_merge_scheduled_slot` now allows run at/after configured minute in the hour (not exact minute match only).
    - Prevents merge sweeps from being skipped when merge scheduling is chained from redemption scheduler at a later minute.
  - Affects `mm_rewards_v1` inventory/risk handling and hourly merge execution for all MM symbols/timeframes.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` full-ladder blocker softening (`src/main.rs`):
  - Added partial-keep path for `full_ladder_required` preflight failures when coverage already meets the configured minimum floor (`min_ladder_levels`).
  - New telemetry event: `mm_rewards_full_ladder_partial_keep`.
  - Behavior change: MM keeps valid covered ladder levels instead of forcing rebalance-only cancel-all when only deep rungs are missing.
  - Affects all `mm_rewards_v1` modes and symbols/timeframes.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` quote lifetime extended for ladder continuity (`.env`):
  - Updated `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_TTL_MS` from `12000` (12s) to `300000` (300s).
  - Affects all `mm_rewards_v1` modes (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`) across all selected symbols/timeframes.
  - Purpose: reduce ladder dropouts caused by short TTL relative to per-condition refresh cadence.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` adaptive ladder-fit for tight reward spreads (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - Added auto-scan feasible-depth gating/ranking:
    - new env `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_MIN_FEASIBLE_LEVELS` (set `2`).
    - scanner now estimates `tick_size`, builds estimated ladders, computes scoring-feasible levels (`up/down/pair`), skips candidates below feasible minimum, and boosts score by feasible-depth ratio.
  - Added auto-scan telemetry fields:
    - `tick_size_est`, `feasible_levels_up_est`, `feasible_levels_down_est`, `feasible_pair_levels_est`.
  - Added runtime ladder adaptation for live MM quoting:
    - when full-ladder mode is active and scoring guard is enabled, MM trims both sides to scoring-feasible depth instead of hard-failing at fixed 5 levels.
    - required ladder depth now uses market-adaptive `required_ladder_levels_market` (e.g., 5 -> 3/2) with minimum floor from `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_MIN_FEASIBLE_LEVELS`.
  - Added runtime capacity telemetry event `mm_rewards_scoring_capacity` and enriched non-scoring logs with feasible-depth fields.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` non-scoring churn reduction + strict scoring clip (`src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Changed ladder scoring-fit checks to strict spread-cap comparison (removed half-tick tolerance drift), so scanner/runtime fit logic matches preflight scoring exactly.
  - Added side-level re-clip after skew/conserve deepen in runtime path:
    - effective ladder is clipped again to scoring-valid prices before preflight/cancel/submit.
  - Added partial-keep behavior for `non_scoring` preflight:
    - if covered levels already meet minimum ladder floor, MM keeps active ladder and skips hard cancel-all.
    - new event: `mm_rewards_non_scoring_partial_keep`.
  - Goal: prevent repeated cancel/repost loops that drop active ladder to zero when only deep rungs fail scoring.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` scoring midpoint source correction (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/mm/scoring_guard.rs`):
  - Runtime scoring midpoint now prioritizes live orderbook-derived midpoint (`best bid/ask`) over market-details midpoint.
  - Auto scanner midpoint selection also prioritizes live books over static details midpoint.
  - Added tiny floating tolerance in local scoring guard (`1e-9`) to avoid false non-scoring on exact boundary equality.
  - Impact: removes repeated 0.5c boundary misses caused by stale midpoint source and float precision edge cases.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` auto-market stability + de-selection cancel hardening (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `.env`):
  - Added sticky auto selection state with minimum market lease:
    - new env `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_MIN_STAY_SEC` (set to `7200`), so an auto-selected market stays at least 2h before replacement.
  - Added controlled rotation budget per refresh:
    - new env `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_ROTATION_BUDGET_PER_REFRESH` (set to `1`), limiting churn to one replacement per refresh cycle.
  - Added hard de-selection cancel for auto markets:
    - when a condition leaves active auto set, MM cancels all open MM orders for that condition immediately (BUY+SELL path).
  - Added trader/db support for condition-wide MM cancel:
    - `Trader::cancel_pending_orders_for_strategy_condition(...)`
    - `TrackingDb::list_open_pending_orders_for_strategy_condition(...)`.
  - Effect: snapshot churn no longer rotates the full book; dropped auto markets are actively removed from book instead of lingering until TTL.
  - Increased auto ranking pool in live env:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_TOP_N: 8 -> 80` to reduce truncation of high-reward candidates before per-mode selection.
  - Added top-reward inclusion guard in auto selector:
    - new env `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_FORCE_TOP_REWARD=true`.
    - if the highest reward-rate candidate is missing from per-mode selection, it is injected into the first enabled mode for that refresh.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-exit/unwind min-size guard hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - Added explicit minimum-share checks (`order_floor.min_size_shares`) before submitting MM SELL exits.
  - Applies to both `competition_high_freeze` exits and regular weak-side rebalance exits.
  - New skip events: `mm_rewards_competition_high_exit_skip_min_size`, `mm_rewards_weak_exit_skip_min_size`.
  - Prevents repeated 400 rejects like `Size (...) lower than the minimum`.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` full-ladder auto selection unblocked (`src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - Fixed ladder deepen behavior when full ladder is required:
    - deepening now shifts rung prices down while preserving rung count, instead of dropping a rung (`covered_levels` no longer forced from 5 -> 4).
  - Auto-market replacement cooldown is no longer set for internal `full_ladder_required` preflight failures.
  - Raised BBO participation threshold to reduce unnecessary deepen triggers:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_BBO1_MAX_SIZE_FRACTION: 0.25 -> 0.40`.
  - Affects `mm_rewards_v1` auto mode across all enabled MM modes.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` stub-book reward scan + ladder anchor fix (`src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Auto scanner now treats extreme stub books (`~0.01/0.99` or very wide spread) specially by using token price hints for reward EV estimation instead of raw top bid.
  - Fixed reward midpoint inference to use YES/UP token price (or `1-NO`) instead of averaging token prices to `0.5`.
  - MM ladder builder now supports per-token price hint and uses it as anchor when book is stub/wide, instead of anchoring at dead `0.01` bids.
  - Effect: high-reward markets with thin/dead top-of-book are no longer incorrectly scored as zero by construction.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` auto-scan source switched to full CLOB universe first (`src/api.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`):
  - Added `get_all_clob_markets()` pagination path on CLOB `/markets` and scanner now loads full market set first.
  - CLOB scan now starts near the tail window (recent offsets) instead of oldest pages, so auto scan sees current/open markets.
  - Auto scanner now filters out inactive/closed/expired markets before ranking and applies reward filters from market `rewards` metadata.
  - Reward feed rows (`/rewards` page) are now optional overlay for competition/reward overrides, not the primary candidate source.
  - Added rewards-feed detail-resolve supplement/fallback path so current reward markets are injected even when CLOB window scan is sparse/old.
  - Candidate pool is sorted by reward rate from full-market scan, then trimmed to scanner budget (`auto_scan_limit * 4`).
  - Auto selection now fully respects `EVPOLY_MM_MIN_REWARD_RATE_HINT` as the reward-rate floor.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` imbalance-rebalance execution update (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `.env`):
  - Added imbalance loss-allowed weak-exit policy with explicit env controls:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_ALLOW_LOSS_ON_IMBALANCE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_IMBALANCE_MAX_LOSS_PCT`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_IMBALANCE_FORCE_TOUCH_RATIO`
  - Weak-exit pricing now supports imbalance-first de-risking:
    - when imbalance is active, exit pricing can step to touch (maker ask) and go below avg entry within configured max-loss floor.
    - normal balanced flow remains profit-target based.
  - Weak-exit cancel/reprice churn reduced:
    - size-only reprices now require both absolute and percentage size delta (`requote_min_size_delta_pct`) instead of any `>=1` share delta.
  - Auto-market replacement cooldown added:
    - auto candidates can be put on temporary cooldown after `competition_high_freeze` or `non_scoring_rebalance_only` outcomes.
    - scanner excludes cooled conditions until expiry and forces early refresh for replacement rotation.
    - env control: `EVPOLY_MM_REPLACEMENT_COOLDOWN_SEC`.

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` reward-safety + execution wiring hardening (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/mm/scoring_guard.rs`, `.env`):
  - Added strict reward-eligibility controls and turned them on in env:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REQUIRE_REWARD_ELIGIBLE=true`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_ALLOW_UNWIND_ONLY_WHEN_NOT_REWARD_ELIGIBLE=true`
    - Non-eligible markets now emit `mm_rewards_skip_not_reward_eligible`, BUY ladders are canceled/blocked, and unwind-only path is allowed when configured.
  - Added auto fail-closed option for rewards feed and enabled it:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_REQUIRE_REWARDS_FEED=true`
    - auto scanner now returns no candidates (instead of full active-market fallback) when rewards feed is unavailable.
  - Enforced strict `auto_top_n` cap in runtime selection (removed implicit widening pool behavior).
  - Wired local scoring guard into MM rung submit path and enabled it:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SCORING_GUARD_ENABLE=true`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SCORING_GUARD_REQUIRE_QMIN=true`
    - New skip event: `mm_rewards_skip_non_scoring_rung`.
    - Scoring guard math corrected to rewards units (`max_spread` cents -> probability delta) and DOWN-side yes-equivalent pricing.
  - Reduced stale-order reconciliation fanout with throttling controls (enabled in env):
    - `EVPOLY_MM_STALE_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS=2000`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_STALE_RECONCILE_MAX_LOOKUPS=8`
    - Prevents per-loop `get_order` storms on every open row.
  - Tightened market-state order counts to execution scope:
    - `open_buy_orders` / `open_sell_orders` now computed by timeframe+period+token scope (same scope as MM execution), reducing state drift.
  - Added mode-cap enforcement in runtime work queue:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_ACTIVE_MARKETS_PER_MODE` now actively limits non-forced work items per mode.
  - Added mode-override handling for inventory-janitor forced items when original mode is disabled, with telemetry (`mm_rewards_inventory_janitor_mode_override`).
  - Auto rank score now uses configured alpha/beta:
    - score = `rank_alpha_reward * expected_reward_day_est - rank_beta_risk * inventory_risk`.
    - `spike_reward_rate_min` is now enforced for spike-mode auto candidates (`mm_rewards_auto_skip_spike_below_reward_min`).

### 2026-03-03
- `mm_rewards_v1` inventory skew trigger + competition-freeze controls updated (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `.env`):
  - Skew guard now triggers on absolute YES/NO inventory imbalance, not only favor/weak ratio context:
    - new threshold env `EVPOLY_MM_INVENTORY_IMBALANCE_TRIGGER_SHARES` (set to `200` shares).
    - when imbalance is above threshold, BUY quoting is blocked/canceled on the overloaded token side.
  - Added competition-level monitoring from rewards feed snapshot + auto-candidate metadata:
    - markets entering `high` competition are put into `competition_high_freeze`.
    - while frozen, MM cancels BUY ladders for the market and pauses new quoting until competition returns to `medium`/`low`.
    - freeze lifecycle events added:
      - `mm_rewards_competition_high_freeze_enter`
      - `mm_rewards_competition_high_freeze_active`
      - `mm_rewards_competition_high_freeze_exit`
  - Added high-competition inventory exit attempts:
    - while market is frozen and inventory exists, bot posts maker `SELL` exits (post-only GTC) per side with current best-ask / avg-entry guard, tracked with existing MM exit state.
    - new events:
      - `mm_rewards_competition_high_exit_submitted`
      - `mm_rewards_competition_high_exit_closed`
      - `mm_rewards_competition_high_exit_failed`
  - New env gate:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_COMPETITION_HIGH_FREEZE_ENABLE=true`.
  - Scope: all `mm_rewards_v1` markets (target and auto modes), all symbols/timeframes currently selected by MM.

### 2026-03-02
- `mm_rewards_v1` auto-mode selection and favor-side behavior updated (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `.env`):
  - Hybrid auto selection now picks one market per enabled MM mode (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`) using mode-fit scoring and per-mode dedupe by `condition_id`.
  - Auto selection pool widened from strict `auto_top_n` slicing to a larger ranked pool (`max(auto_top_n, enabled_modes*8)`) before per-mode top-1 pick.
  - Added mode-aware auto selector helper: `select_top_candidate_per_mode(...)` with explicit scoring heuristics and sports/tail detection.
  - Favor-side logic is now dynamic when `EVPOLY_MM_FAVOR_SIDE=none`:
    - if UP reference price (`mid/bbo`) >= `0.85` and dominant -> favor UP,
    - else if DOWN reference price >= `0.85` and dominant -> favor DOWN,
    - else stay neutral (`none`).
  - `mm_rewards_quote_plan` telemetry now logs:
    - `favor_side_configured`, `favor_side_effective`,
    - `favor_side_threshold_price`,
    - `up_reference_price`, `down_reference_price`.
  - MM env defaults aligned for requested behavior:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_FAVOR_SIDE=none`
    - all four mode flags enabled.

- `mm_rewards_v1` hybrid scheduler fix: target + auto now run together (`src/main.rs`):
  - Reworked MM work-item scheduling so `hybrid` mode processes both configured target selectors and auto-selected candidates in the same loop.
  - Fixed prior behavior where presence of `single_market_selectors` implicitly disabled auto execution.
  - Added per-loop condition dedupe (`condition_id`) to prevent double-processing when target and auto overlap.
  - Added explicit MM skip telemetry for previously silent paths:
    - `mm_rewards_skip_missing_token_id`
    - `mm_rewards_skip_orderbook_fetch`
    - `mm_rewards_skip_ladder_empty`
    - `mm_rewards_skip_period_elapsed`
    - `mm_rewards_skip_duplicate_work_item`
  - Added `source=target|auto` tagging in `mm_rewards_quote_plan` for attribution/debug.
  - Also adjusted single-market fill-cap short-circuit so it does not block auto processing in hybrid.
  - Runtime config aligned for validation with both sources enabled together:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_MODE=hybrid` with non-empty `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUGS`.
  - Added auto-market enrichment for token IDs/outcomes (`src/main.rs`):
    - If auto candidate payload is missing directional token mapping, MM now fetches full market by slug and caches it (10m) before quote processing.
    - New diagnostics:
      - `mm_rewards_auto_market_enrich_failed`
      - `mm_rewards_auto_market_enrich_mismatch`
  - Hardened directional token selection fallback (`src/main.rs`):
    - `select_token_id_for_direction` now falls back to deterministic binary mapping (`ids[0]` for UP, `ids[1]` for DOWN) when outcomes are missing/unparseable.
    - This prevents repeated `mm_rewards_skip_missing_token_id` on binary auto markets with incomplete outcome payloads.
  - Market-slug discovery hardening for MM auto enrichment (`src/api.rs`):
    - `get_market_by_slug` now attempts direct Gamma `/markets?slug=...` lookup first, then falls back to event-slug discovery.
    - Added market JSON normalization before deserialize:
      - array `clobTokenIds`/`outcomes` -> JSON-string format expected by `Market`
      - `endDate` fallback into `endDateISO`
      - default `active/closed` if missing
    - Reduced `mm_rewards_auto_market_enrich_failed` on market-slug inputs.

- `mm_rewards_v1` target-market pin restored for Fed/Warsh set (`.env`):
  - Switched MM rewards market mode from `hybrid` back to `target`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_MODE=target`
  - Restored explicit single-market selector rotation across the 5 intended markets:
    - `fed-decision-in-april / 25 bps decrease`
    - `fed-decision-in-april / no change`
    - `fed-decision-in-march-885 / 25 bps decrease`
    - `fed-decision-in-march-885 / no change`
    - `who-will-trump-nominate-as-fed-chair / kevin-warsh`
    - via `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUGS=...`
  - Effect: MM rewards loop now prioritizes these configured markets instead of auto-selected non-target markets.

- `mm_rewards_v1` auto-ranker refinement for reward floor + competition estimate (`src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Auto-scan competition baseline now uses reward-min-size in normalized shares (`shares` mode uses raw min-size; `usd` mode converts min-size by reference price before scoring).
  - This keeps rank estimates consistent with runtime reward-min-size enforcement and avoids overestimating score when `min_size` is not share-denominated.
  - Added API competition signal from Gamma market payload (`market.competitive` in range `[0,1]`) into scanner candidate state.
    - Stored/logged as:
      - `competition_score_api`
      - `competition_level_api` (`low` `<0.33`, `medium` `<0.66`, else `high`)
    - Ranking risk now includes this competition signal (higher competition lowers effective rank score).
  - Auto-scan telemetry now emits scoring internals in both snapshot and selection logs:
    - `expected_reward_day_est`
    - `reward_efficiency_est`
    - `capital_locked_est`
    - `our_share_est`
    - `our_qmin_est`
    - `competition_qmin_est`
    - `competition_score_api`
    - `competition_level_api`
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` auto/hybrid market selection only.

- `mm_rewards_v1` auto-ranker source/objective upgrade (`src/api.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Auto candidate universe now prioritizes rewards-page market feed (`/rewards` dehydrated payload) instead of first-page Gamma events.
    - Fallback remains paginated Gamma active markets when rewards payload fetch fails.
  - Added rewards-feed competition signal ingestion:
    - raw field: `market_competitiveness`
    - normalized risk score: log-scaled into `[0,1]`
    - API bucket level emitted as `low|medium|high`.
  - Ranking objective changed to prioritize absolute expected reward capture:
    - primary: `expected_reward_day_est`
    - secondary: reward efficiency
    - both risk-adjusted via existing alpha/beta controls.
  - Added telemetry fields:
    - `competition_raw_api`
    - `competition_source_api` (`rewards_market_competitiveness|gamma_market_competitive|none`)
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` auto/hybrid market discovery, ranking, and selection quality.

- `mm_rewards_v1` ranking objective switched to budgeted reward/day + hybrid rollout (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - Auto ranking now uses **estimated reward/day** as primary score (instead of efficiency-heavy score).
  - Ranking share model now uses a budgeted capital model:
    - `shares_for_rank = auto_rank_budget_usd / (best_bid_up + best_bid_down)`
    - with reward min-size floor still enforced.
  - Added config:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_RANK_BUDGET_USD` (default `2000`, matching 200 USD x 10 ladder levels total).
  - Runtime env rollout updates:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_MODE=hybrid`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_TOP_N=5`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_RANK_BUDGET_USD=2000`
    - cleared single-market selector overrides to allow auto/hybrid selection:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUGS=`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUG=`
  - Startup and auto-scan telemetry now include `auto_rank_budget_usd`.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` auto market selection/ranking only; execution path unchanged.

- `mm_rewards_v1` market-details parser hardening for auto-scan (`src/models.rs`):
  - `MarketDetails.end_date_iso` now deserializes `null` as empty string instead of hard-failing parse.
  - Fixes repeated CLOB market parse failures in MM auto universe scans on markets where `end_date_iso` is null.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` auto/hybrid candidate fetch reliability.

- `mm_rewards_v1` reward min-size enforcement in ladder sizing (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Added reward-floor config controls:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_SIZE_ENFORCE` (default `true`)
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REWARD_MIN_SIZE_UNIT=shares|usd` (default `shares`)
  - MM BUY ladder sizing now enforces reward min-size before submit:
    - side size = `max(adaptive_size, reward_min_floor_for_price)`,
    - applied per rung (price-aware conversion when `unit=usd`).
  - BBO1 concentration/deepen checks now use reward-floor-adjusted effective size.
  - Added telemetry fields in quote-plan/submit/skip logs for reward floor:
    - `reward_min_size_enforce`, `reward_min_size_unit`, `reward_min_size_raw`, `reward_min_shares_for_rung`.
  - Added unit tests for reward min-size conversion helper in `src/main.rs` tests.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` only.

- `mm_rewards_v1` Chunk-5 attribution + rollout controls (`src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - Added per-market MM attribution query + structs in `src/tracking_db.rs`:
    - `summarize_mm_market_attribution(strategy_id, from_ts_ms)` with:
      - trade realized PnL (`settlements_v2`)
      - merge/reward/redemption cashflow (`wallet_cashflow_events_v1`)
      - open carry snapshot (`positions_v2` open units/notional)
      - net per market.
    - `summarize_wallet_cashflow_unattributed_by_event(...)` for condition-less cashflow visibility.
  - Extended MM admin status payload in `src/trader.rs` (`mm_rewards_status`):
    - `attribution_24h`, `attribution_all`
    - `attribution_totals_24h`, `attribution_totals_all`
    - `cashflow_unattributed_24h`, `cashflow_unattributed_all`
    - `rollout_flags`.
  - Added admin reporting endpoint in `src/main.rs`:
    - `GET /admin/mm/attribution?window=24h|all`
    - returns rows + totals + unattributed cashflow for selected window.
  - Added staged rollout action toggles in `src/mm/mod.rs` and wired in `src/main.rs`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_CONSERVE_ACTIONS_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_UNWIND_ACTIONS_ENABLE`
    - conserve/unwind telemetry remains visible even when actions are disabled.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` only; other strategies unchanged.

- `mm_rewards_v1` Chunk-4 adaptive quoting controls + markout pipeline (`src/mm/metrics.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`):
  - Added markout runtime pipeline (100ms/1s/5s) with prefill-drift/pickoff tracking:
    - new tracker types in `src/mm/metrics.rs` store BBO snapshots, submit anchors, fill samples, EWMA stats, and per-condition state.
    - new DB query in `src/tracking_db.rs`:
      - `list_entry_fill_events_since(strategy_id, since_ts_ms, limit)` for MM fill ingestion.
    - new telemetry:
      - `mm_rewards_markout_sample`
      - `mm_rewards_markout_sample_invalid`
      - `mm_rewards_markout_scan_error`
      - `mm_rewards_conserve_on` / `mm_rewards_conserve_off`
      - `mm_rewards_unwind_gate_triggered` / `mm_rewards_unwind_gate_cleared`
  - Added adaptive requote hysteresis/churn controls in `src/main.rs`:
    - reprice-cancel now requires meaningful drift by price ticks or ladder-level gap.
    - new envs:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_REQUOTE_MIN_PRICE_DELTA_TICKS`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_REQUOTE_MIN_SIZE_DELTA_PCT`
  - Added continuous inventory-skew sizing/deepening controls in `src/main.rs`:
    - side size multiplier and ladder deepening now respond to side inventory ratio + favor/weak skew.
    - new envs:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_SKEW_RATIO_SOFT`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_SKEW_RATIO_HARD`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_SKEW_SIZE_MULT_MIN`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_SKEW_DEEPEN_LEVELS_MAX`
  - Added conserve/unwind gates driven by markout + inventory in `src/main.rs`:
    - conserve mode reduces levels/size and deepens ladder during toxic windows.
    - unwind gate cancels favored-side BUY ladder pressure when inventory is high and markout is sufficiently negative.
  - Added/normalized MM markout env controls in `src/mm/mod.rs`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_ENABLE`, `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_GATE_BPS`, `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_RECOVER_BPS`, `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_MIN_SAMPLES`, `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_MAX_BOOK_AGE_MS`, `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_WINSOR_BPS`, `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_EWMA_HALFLIFE_FILLS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_PREFILL_DRIFT_*`, `EVPOLY_MM_PICKOFF_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_CONSERVE_*`, `EVPOLY_MM_UNWIND_*`
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` only; other strategies unchanged.

- `mm_rewards_v1` Chunk-3 auto selector + RV-aware ranking (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Added auto/hybrid market-scanning controls:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_SCAN_LIMIT`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MIN_REWARD_RATE_HINT`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_RANK_ALPHA_REWARD`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_RANK_BETA_RISK`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_RV_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_RV_WINDOW_SHORT_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_RV_WINDOW_MID_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_RV_WINDOW_LONG_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_RV_BLOCK_THRESHOLD`
  - Implemented reward scanner/ranker in `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`:
    - scans active markets via Gamma events,
    - loads market details + UP/DOWN orderbooks,
    - computes reward snapshot, spread quality, midpoint history RV (`short/mid/long`), and risk-adjusted score,
    - filters low-reward and high-RV markets (when RV gate is enabled),
    - returns ranked candidates for runtime selection.
  - Runtime integration in `src/main.rs`:
    - periodic auto refresh (`auto_refresh_sec`) with structured telemetry:
      - `mm_rewards_auto_scan_snapshot`
      - `mm_rewards_auto_scan_error`
      - `mm_rewards_auto_market_selected`
    - `market_mode=auto` now actively selects and trades ranked markets (instead of scaffold-only idle) when candidates exist.
    - `market_mode=hybrid` now uses auto-ranked market per mode when available, with target-mode fallback when auto set is empty.
    - heartbeat now includes `auto_selected_count` and effective market-mode context.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` market selection/discovery path for all MM modes (`quiet_stack`, `tail_biased`, `spike`, `sports_pregame`).

- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-side maker-exit stability hardening (`src/main.rs`, `src/mm/mod.rs`):
  - Added reserved-aware weak inventory handling for exit cancel decisions:
    - effective weak inventory now uses `available_balance + reserved_open_exit_shares` instead of raw available balance only.
  - Added no-inventory cancel suppression to prevent submit/cancel flapping:
    - settle grace gate before cancel: `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_SETTLE_GRACE_MS` (default `3000`).
    - consecutive low-inventory confirmation loops before cancel:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_NO_INVENTORY_CONFIRM_LOOPS` (default `3`).
  - Added weak-exit cancel/replace anti-flap budget:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_MAX_REPLACES_PER_MIN` (default `20`).
    - emits `mm_rewards_weak_exit_flap_detected` when budget exhausted.
  - Enforced strict single-live-order behavior on weak-side reprice:
    - reprice path now cancels and waits settle grace before replacement submit (no same-loop cancel+replace).
  - Added new MM weak-exit telemetry:
    - `mm_rewards_weak_exit_suppressed_no_inventory_grace`
    - `mm_rewards_weak_exit_flap_detected`
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` weak-side maker exit behavior across all configured MM markets.

- `mm_rewards_v1` Chunk-1 foundation/config cleanup (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`):
  - Added market-mode scaffolding for MM operation:
    - new enum/config: `target | auto | hybrid` via `EVPOLY_MM_MARKET_MODE`.
    - added auto placeholders for upcoming selector rollout:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_TOP_N`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_REFRESH_SEC`
  - Runtime behavior kept backward-compatible for current target flow:
    - existing target/single-market path remains unchanged.
    - `auto` mode is scaffold-only in this chunk (explicit telemetry + heartbeat context, no auto selector execution yet).
  - Added MM mode telemetry context in startup and heartbeat:
    - `market_mode_requested`
    - `market_mode_effective`
  - Unified dynamic-markout env parsing (cleanup for upcoming MM controls):
    - canonical key: `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_DYNAMIC_ENABLE`
    - canonical gate key: `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_DYNAMIC_K_GATE`
    - legacy alias fallback retained:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_DYNAMIC_GATE_ENABLE`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_DYNAMIC_GATE_K`
    - recover key: `EVPOLY_MM_MARKOUT_DYNAMIC_K_RECOVER`
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` config/runtime metadata across all MM-targeted symbols/timeframes.

- `mm_rewards_v1` tracking/audit hardening (`src/main.rs`, `src/tracking_db.rs`, `src/trader.rs`, `src/api.rs`):
  - Added MM market-state persistence table `mm_market_states_v1` and runtime upserts per active MM condition (state/reason/open buy+sell counts/inventory/ladder bounds/last event time).
  - Added admin status endpoint `GET /admin/mm/status` returning live MM market states + wallet cashflow summaries (`24h` and all-time) for `mm_rewards_v1`.
  - Added Polymarket Data API activity sync for MM cashflows:
    - new activity fetch path in API client (`get_user_activity`),
    - runtime ingest loop (default enabled) writes `REDEMPTION_CONFIRMED`, `MERGE_SUCCESS`, `MAKER_REBATE`-style rows into `wallet_cashflow_events_v1` with idempotent `cashflow_key`.
    - new env controls:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_ACTIVITY_SYNC_ENABLE`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_ACTIVITY_USER`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_ACTIVITY_SYNC_SEC`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_ACTIVITY_SYNC_LIMIT`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_WATCHDOG_NO_LADDER_SEC`
  - Added no-active-ladder watchdog log path (`mm_rewards_watchdog_no_ladder`) driven by persisted per-condition last-active timestamps.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` all symbols/timeframes currently selected via MM market selectors.

- Fill-accounting correction for MM sell fills (`src/trader.rs`):
  - `on_order_filled` is now side-aware:
    - BUY fills remain `ENTRY_FILL`,
    - SELL fills are recorded as `EXIT` with realized PnL estimate vs tracked average entry price.
  - Prevents MM weak-side sell fills from being incorrectly booked as entry fills.
  - This impacts lifecycle accounting quality for any strategy path that can fill SELL through pending-order reconcile; primary target is `mm_rewards_v1` weak-side maker exits.

- Merge cashflow tracking extension (`src/trader.rs`):
  - Successful merge submit paths now emit `MERGE_SUBMITTED` cashflow rows (manual condition merge + scheduled/manual merge sweep success paths), improving realized cash tracking beyond settlement-only views.

- Merge/redeem ops reliability + MM runtime tuning (`src/trader.rs`, `.env`):
  - Merge sweep candidate detection is now token-type agnostic:
    - switched from crypto-only `TokenType::{Up,Down}` pairing to per-condition token-id pairing from live pending inventory.
    - merge scan now also ingests configured MM selector markets (`EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUGS` / `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUG`) and pulls condition token ids directly from Gamma event/market slug resolution.
    - token-id extraction supports both `tokens[]` and `clobTokenIds` payload formats from Gamma responses.
    - this allows hourly/manual merge sweeps to detect and merge non-crypto/MM-rewards binary markets (e.g., Fed markets) instead of silently finding zero candidates.
    - per-condition UP/DOWN balance probes now run concurrently (join) to reduce merge sweep latency.
  - MM capital/risk headroom raised:
    - `POLY_MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_USD`: `6000 -> 10000` (soft exposure guard rises accordingly).
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_FAVOR_INVENTORY_SHARES`: `2000 -> 10000`.
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_WEAK_INVENTORY_SHARES`: `2000 -> 10000`.
  - MM reaction speed increased (event-driven fallback and reprice cadence):
    - `EVPOLY_MM_POLL_MS`: `250 -> 200`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_EVENT_FALLBACK_POLL_MS`: `750 -> 250`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REPRICE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`: `300 -> 120`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_TTL_MS`: `20000 -> 12000`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_CONSTRAINTS_CACHE_MS`: `30000 -> 10000`
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` runtime behavior and global merge sweep execution.

- Execution-layer reliability update across strategy order paths (`src/api.rs`):
  - Added builder-attribution fail-open behavior:
    - if builder `/order` post returns auth error (`401/403`), runtime disables builder posting for the current run and continues with standard CLOB posting path on retries.
    - prevents builder credential issues from hard-blocking `premarket_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, and `mm_rewards_v1`.
  - Reduced auth-cache churn in balance probes:
    - `check_balance_only` and `check_balance_allowance` now refresh auth client only on auth errors.
    - non-auth balance-call failures use a same-client transient retry instead of forcing global client reset.
  - Effect:
    - fewer forced re-auth cycles during high-frequency loops (especially `mm_rewards_v1` weak-side inventory checks),
    - lower probability of cascading `ENTRY_FAILED` bursts caused by repeated auth rebuilds.
- `mm_rewards_v1` multi-market single-slug expansion (`src/mm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `.env`):
  - Added multi-selector env:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUGS` (comma-separated list; supports full Polymarket URLs and `event_slug/market_slug` selectors).
  - Runtime single-market mode now:
    - iterates configured selectors every poll cycle (using repeated quiet-stack passes; no longer one hardcoded slug only),
    - applies the same quote/ladder/reprice/favor-side/weak-exit logic per selected market.
  - Fill-cap safety changed from global stop to per-condition stop:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_MAX_ENTRY_FILLS` now halts only the market that reached cap, while other configured markets continue.
  - Updated live env selector list to include Fed + requested additional markets:
    - March no-change,
    - March -25bps cut,
    - April no-change,
    - April -25bps cut,
    - Trump/Kevin Warsh Fed Chair nomination market.
  - Runtime cap update in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_MAX_ENTRY_FILLS` set from `5` -> `0` (unlimited; no per-market auto-stop on fill count).

### 2026-03-01
- `evcurve_v1` chase overfill hardening in `src/main.rs` + `.env`:
  - Added first-fill stop for EVcurve chase loops:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_CHASE_STOP_ON_FIRST_FILL` (default enabled in env)
    - On first detected fill notional in a chase cycle, bot cancels scope BUY orders and exits chase.
  - Added stricter single-live-order handling inside chase:
    - if multiple open pending rows are detected for EVcurve scope, cancel-all and pause re-place.
    - added pending-action gate with cancel-settle wait and action-timeout guard to prevent rapid cancel/place overlap.
  - Added EVcurve-specific entry cap:
    - `EVPOLY_MAX_EVCURVE_ENTRIES_PER_TIMEFRAME_PERIOD=1`
    - worker cap routing now uses this for `evcurve_v1` instead of global reactive default.
  - New EVcurve chase env controls:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_CHASE_CANCEL_SETTLE_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_CHASE_ACTION_TIMEOUT_MS`
  - Affects EVcurve chase execution across enabled symbols/timeframes (not MM reward flow).
  - Runtime adjustment:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_CHASE_STOP_ON_FIRST_FILL` set to `false` in `.env` so chase can continue filling remainder toward target size (instead of stopping after first partial fill).
  - Checkpoint-late tolerance runtime override:
    - set `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_MAX_LATE_MS=60000` in `.env` (effective late-window widening without changing code default in `src/evcurve.rs`).

- `evcurve_v1` size scale-up in `.env` (2x sizing rollout):
  - Doubled non-D1 and D1 strategy caps:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_STRATEGY_CAP_USD`: `10000 -> 20000`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_D1_STRATEGY_CAP_USD`: `6000 -> 12000`
  - Doubled D1 fixed size:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_D1_SIZE_USD`: `500 -> 1000`
  - Doubled per-scope caps and explicitly set 1h/4h caps (to ensure true 2x vs default fallbacks):
    - `15m`: BTC/ETH `500 -> 1000`, SOL/XRP `200 -> 400`
    - `1h`: BTC/ETH `600`, SOL/XRP `300` (new explicit overrides)
    - `4h`: BTC/ETH `800`, SOL/XRP `400` (new explicit overrides)
    - `1d`: all symbols `1000 -> 2000`
  - Affects `BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP` across `15m/1h/4h/1d`.

- `premarket_v1` size scale-up in `.env` (2x side budgets):
  - `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_SIDE_BUDGET_5M_USD`: `200 -> 400`
  - `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_SIDE_BUDGET_15M_USD`: `400 -> 800`
  - `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_SIDE_BUDGET_1H_USD`: `600 -> 1200`
  - `EVPOLY_PREMARKET_SIDE_BUDGET_4H_USD`: `800 -> 1600`
  - Symbol multipliers unchanged (`BTC 1.0`, `ETH/SOL/XRP 0.5`), so effective per-symbol budget doubles.
  - Affects `BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP` across `5m/15m/1h/4h`.

- `liqaccum_v1` multi-asset rollout backport from `liqaccum-normal-size` into `Poly-builder`:
  - Strategy loop now runs across `BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP` (using `premarket_assets`) instead of single-symbol behavior.
  - Added per-timeframe enable parsing in config:
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_TIMEFRAMES` (supports `5m,15m,1h,4h` and optional `1d` parsing fallback).
  - Added per-asset sizing multipliers in config:
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_ASSET_MULT_BTC`
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_ASSET_MULT_ETH`
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_ASSET_MULT_SOL`
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_ASSET_MULT_XRP`
  - Added `4h`-specific LiqAccum sizing/buffer/slice config paths in `src/strategy_liqaccum.rs`:
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_BUFFER_BPS_4H`
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_BASE_USD_4H`
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_MAX_USD_4H`
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_SLICE_COUNT_4H`
  - LiqAccum discovery switched to per `(timeframe, asset)` cache/backoff discovery loop in `src/main.rs` (no longer dependent on single `reactive_market_cache` slot per timeframe).
  - Direction locks/reject counters are now scoped by `(timeframe, period, market_key)` to prevent cross-symbol lock collisions.

- `liqaccum_v1` adaptive reprice upgrade aligned to EVcurve proxy math, with down-only replace policy:
  - Reprice now uses EVcurve proxy source selection via `read_evcurve_proxy_snapshot`:
    - Coinbase proxy for `5m/15m/4h`
    - Binance proxy for `1h`
  - Reprice live cap now computed with shared adaptive chase math (`compute_live_fair_state`) using proxy-vs-PM dislocation and buffers.
  - Added LiqAccum proxy/PM staleness env:
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_PROXY_STALE_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_PM_QUOTE_FRESH_MS`
  - Reprice remains explicitly **down-only**:
    - only cancels/replaces when new target bid is lower than working bid by min tick delta,
    - never chases up.
  - Added/extended LiqAccum reprice telemetry payload with proxy/dislocation fields in `src/main.rs`.

- `mm_rewards_v1` single-market canary retarget + sizing model update:
  - Retargeted MM single-market test in `.env` to:
    - `https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-march-885/will-there-be-no-change-in-fed-interest-rates-after-the-march-2026-meeting`
  - Kept one-market fill stop guard unchanged:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_MAX_ENTRY_FILLS=5`
- `mm_rewards_v1` size semantics changed from **USD notional** to **share count**:
  - Replaced config keys in `src/mm/mod.rs` + `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_USD_PER_SIDE` -> `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_SHARES_PER_SIDE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REFILL_USD_PER_FILL` -> `EVPOLY_MM_REFILL_SHARES_PER_FILL`
  - Quote planner now carries `size_shares` (`src/mm/quote_manager.rs`).
  - Runtime converts shares to notional at submit-time (`size_usd = shares * submit_price`) so existing arbiter/trader pipeline remains compatible (`src/main.rs` MM loop).
  - Added MM telemetry fields for shares:
    - `size_shares`, `target_size_shares`.
- `mm_rewards_v1` submit-cap removal for per-token period:
  - Removed MM-specific submit cap env usage from worker gating in `src/main.rs`.
  - `EVPOLY_MAX_MM_REWARDS_SUBMITS_PER_TOKEN_PERIOD` is no longer used.
  - MM submit scope is now bounded by other guards (entry cap, arbiter caps, fill-stop, quote logic), not by submit-count cap.

### 2026-02-28
- `mm_rewards_v1` emergency safety + single-market canary mode (live control hardening):
  - Added single-market runtime override in `src/mm/mod.rs` + `src/main.rs`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUG`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_TARGET`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_MAX_ENTRY_FILLS`
  - `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUG` now accepts:
    - plain slug,
    - `event_slug/market_slug`,
    - full Polymarket event URL (`.../event/<event_slug>/<market_slug>`).
    - When two slugs are provided, MM resolves by event slug and enforces exact market slug match (prevents selecting wrong market in multi-market events).
  - Behavior:
    - when `EVPOLY_MM_SINGLE_MARKET_SLUG` is set, MM ignores 4-mode discovery and trades only that slug.
    - after `N` entry fills on that condition (`ENTRY_FILL` distinct order IDs), MM cancels remaining working quotes and fully stops quoting for that run.
  - Added YES/NO token mapping support in `select_token_id_for_direction` so MM can quote non-UP/DOWN binary events safely.
  - Added strict MM notional guard in `src/trader.rs`:
    - `mm_rewards` entries are now rejected if Polymarket min-size enforcement would upsize notional materially above requested budget (prevents accidental large notional fills from order-floor mismatch).
  - Follow-up fix in `src/trader.rs`:
    - MM notional guard now uses the actual request notional (`size_override * price`) rather than global fixed trade amount, so normal `$20` MM orders pass while oversized auto-upsize attempts are blocked.
  - Updated `.env` canary config:
    - only one MM market enabled,
    - quote/refill size raised to `$20` per side,
    - single target slug set to `us-strikes-iraq-by-march-7`,
    - hard stop after `5` MM entry fills,
    - raised MM arbiter cap headroom to avoid cap-side false blocks during canary.

- `mm_rewards_v1` initial rollout (canary-capable execution path):
  - Added new MM module namespace:
    - `src/mm/mod.rs`
    - `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`
    - `src/mm/quote_manager.rs`
    - `src/mm/scoring_guard.rs`
    - `src/mm/risk_supervisor.rs`
    - `src/mm/inventory_engine.rs`
    - `src/mm/ws_router.rs`
    - `src/mm/metrics.rs`
  - Added strategy ID and runtime integration:
    - `STRATEGY_ID_MM_REWARDS_V1 = "mm_rewards_v1"` in `src/strategy.rs`.
    - Exported MM module from `src/lib.rs`.
    - Added MM strategy cap env support in `src/arbiter.rs`:
      - `EVPOLY_ARB_STRAT_MM_REWARDS_MAX_USD`.
  - Added new execution mode in `src/trader.rs`:
    - `EntryExecutionMode::MmRewards` (`entry_mode="mm_rewards"`).
    - Added dedicated TTL cancel maintenance path keyed by:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_TTL_MS`.
    - Added post-only alias env support:
      - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_POST_ONLY_MM_REWARDS`.
  - Main runtime loop integration in `src/main.rs`:
    - New startup config + boot summary via env-based MM config (`mm::MmRewardsConfig`).
    - New loop discovers configured market per mode, builds paired UP/DOWN maker quote plan, submits via arbiter/trader, and reprices by cancel+replace when quote drifts.
    - Refill behavior supported by re-submitting fresh side size when no open pending order is present.
    - Emits MM telemetry events:
      - `mm_rewards_quote_plan`
      - `mm_rewards_quote_submitted`
      - `mm_rewards_skip_*`
      - `mm_rewards_heartbeat`
  - Added MM-specific entry invariant caps in `src/main.rs` worker path to avoid timeframe-cap starvation against two-sided quoting:
    - `EVPOLY_MAX_MM_REWARDS_ENTRIES_PER_TIMEFRAME_PERIOD` (default `20`)
    - `EVPOLY_MAX_MM_REWARDS_SUBMITS_PER_TOKEN_PERIOD` (default `entries*6`)
  - Canary safety refinements:
    - Quote manager now places maker bids one tick below top bid (or two ticks below ask fallback) to reduce post-only cross rejects (`src/mm/quote_manager.rs`).
    - Added explicit ask-aware clamp (`price <= best_ask - 2*ticks`) in maker quote construction for MM bids to further reduce post-only crosses during fast book shifts.
    - MM live submit path now enforces order-floor gate before submit:
      - skip when configured canary size is below required market minimum notional/shares.
      - emits `mm_rewards_skip_below_order_floor` with required floor values.
  - New MM env surface (defaults in code, override in `.env`):
    - `EVPOLY_STRATEGY_MM_REWARDS_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_HARD_DISABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MODE` (`shadow|live`)
    - `EVPOLY_MM_POLL_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_TTL_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_ACTIVE_MARKETS_PER_MODE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_USD_PER_SIDE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_REFILL_USD_PER_FILL`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MIN_PRICE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_PRICE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MIN_TICK_MOVE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_ENABLE_QUIET_STACK`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_ENABLE_TAIL_BIASED`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_ENABLE_SPIKE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_ENABLE_SPORTS_PREGAME`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_TARGET_QUIET_STACK`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_TARGET_TAIL_BIASED`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_TARGET_SPIKE`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_TARGET_SPORTS_PREGAME`

- `liqaccum_v1` execution update: adaptive **down-only** repricing for resting BUY orders:
  - Added runtime reprice loop inside LiqAccum strategy scheduler (`src/main.rs`) that checks open `liqaccum` pending BUY orders per scope (`timeframe + period + token`) and reprices only when market moves against resting bid.
  - Behavior:
    - fetches live PM top (`best_bid`/`best_ask`) for token,
    - computes `live_cap` from current plan `reservation_price`,
    - if `working_price` is above `target_bid=min(book, live_cap)` by at least configured ticks, cancels scope orders and submits replacement lower,
    - **no chase-up** (down-only).
  - Added anti-churn guards:
    - cooldown per scope,
    - duplicate target-price suppression.
  - New env/config in `src/strategy_liqaccum.rs`:
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_ADAPTIVE_REPRICE_ENABLE` (default `true`)
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_ADAPTIVE_REPRICE_COOLDOWN_MS` (default `1000`)
    - `EVPOLY_LIQACCUM_ADAPTIVE_REPRICE_MIN_TICKS` (default `1`)
  - Added telemetry event:
    - `liqaccum_reprice_submitted`
  - Touched code paths:
    - `src/main.rs`
    - `src/strategy_liqaccum.rs`

- `evcurve_v1` adaptive chase hardening pass (plan items 2/5/6/8/9/10) in `src/main.rs` + `src/adaptive_chase.rs`:
  - Added explicit re-anchor policy wiring for adaptive chase anchors:
    - interval-based (`EVPOLY_CHASE_REANCHOR_INTERVAL_MS`)
    - proxy move threshold (`EVPOLY_CHASE_REANCHOR_PROXY_BPS`)
    - dislocation move threshold (`EVPOLY_CHASE_REANCHOR_DISLOC_BPS`)
  - Added race-safety and duplicate suppression in replace/place path:
    - duplicate target suppress window (`EVPOLY_CHASE_DUPLICATE_REPLACE_SUPPRESS_MS`)
    - post-cancel fill re-read and remainder recompute before re-submit
    - nonce-tagged cancel/place telemetry fields for in-flight action tracing
  - Enforced single-writer ownership per EVcurve chase scope (`strategy/symbol/tf/period/token/sub_strategy`) so only one worker can mutate one chase intent scope at a time.
  - Replaced hard-fail behavior for live decision compute issues with safe fallback pause:
    - cancel stale remainder, pause/retry, and only hard-stop after capped failures (`EVPOLY_CHASE_FALLBACK_FAIL_LIMIT`)
  - Added per-intent replace budget (`EVPOLY_CHASE_MAX_REPLACES_TOTAL`) in addition to per-second replace breaker.
  - Added cutoff precedence handling (`EVPOLY_CHASE_CUTOFF_GUARD_MS`):
    - if cutoff is reached during/after replace/place path, scope cancel is forced and chase exits immediately.

- `evcurve_v1` execution-layer upgrade: **Adaptive Chase-Limit v1** (BUY chase path, non-D1 phases):
  - Replaced static 10s chase submit loop with event-driven adaptive repricing in `src/main.rs` EVcurve chase worker.
  - Chase now reacts to:
    - Coinbase proxy trade notify (or fallback timer),
    - PM top-of-book change detection,
    - fallback safety tick.
  - Added live cap computation pipeline (`max_buy_live`) using:
    - strategy model cap (`max_buy_curve_live` from EVcurve decision),
    - proxy-vs-PM dislocation fair shift,
    - edge/vol/stale/expiry buffers,
    - hard-stop cancel when live cap drops below min buy.
  - Added remainder-aware replace behavior:
    - preserves filled notional,
    - cancels scoped open EVcurve pending BUY orders for replace,
    - re-submits only remainder with updated target bid,
    - per-second replace breaker + min replace interval.
  - Phase-3 FAK now uses adaptive `max_buy_live` guard instead of static initial cap.
  - Added structured telemetry events:
    - `evcurve_chase_live_update`
    - `evcurve_chase_replace_cancel`
    - `evcurve_chase_state`
    - `evcurve_chase_hard_stop`
  - Added new env/config surface (execution layer):
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_KAPPA_5M`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_KAPPA_15M`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_KAPPA_1H`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_KAPPA_4H`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_EDGE_BUFFER`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_VOL_A`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_VOL_B`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_MIN_REPLACE_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_MIN_PRICE_IMPROVE_TICKS`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_FALLBACK_TICK_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_MAX_REPLACES_PER_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_HEALTHY_RESUME_MS`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_STALE_BUFFER_MULT`
    - `EVPOLY_CHASE_EXPIRY_BUFFER_MAX`
  - Code paths touched:
    - `src/adaptive_chase.rs` (new pure computation/state module + unit tests)
    - `src/main.rs` (EVcurve chase worker integration + telemetry)
    - `src/trader.rs` (`cancel_pending_orders_for_scope`)
    - `src/tracking_db.rs` (`list_open_pending_orders_for_strategy_scope`)
    - `src/lib.rs` (module export)

- `evcurve_v1` chase fill-accounting hard fix:
  - Fixed EVcurve chase filled-notional tracking key in `src/main.rs` to match trader trade-key format.
  - `trade_key LIKE` now uses `..._evcurve_%_<tf>_<strategy>_tickN` (removed sub-strategy suffix mismatch).
  - Impact: prevents over-submission in chase phases when fills are present but were previously missed by the matcher.
  - Code path touched:
    - `src/main.rs` (`evcurve_trade_key_like` in EVcurve worker task).

- `sessionband_v1` sizing update (live env):
  - Per-symbol fixed size changed in `.env`:
    - `BTC=600`, `ETH=600`, `SOL=300`, `XRP=125` USD.
  - Per-scope caps aligned to new size map:
    - `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_SCOPE_CAP_<SYMBOL>_<TF>` updated for `5m/15m/1h/4h`.

- `evcurve_v1` 15m sizing update (live env):
  - Added explicit 15m scope-cap overrides in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_SCOPE_CAP_BTC_15M=500`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_SCOPE_CAP_ETH_15M=500`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_SCOPE_CAP_SOL_15M=200`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_SCOPE_CAP_XRP_15M=200`
  - Affects EVcurve classic checkpoints on `15m` (requested size uses scope cap in `src/main.rs`).

- `evcurve_v1` 15m checkpoint/routing updates:
  - Disabled 15m `tick3` (`T-120s`) via new env-gated checkpoint skip:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_15M_DISABLE_T3=true`
  - Added dedicated 15m `tick2` (`T-180s`) max-buy curve override:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_15M_T2_MAXBUY_CURVE=0:0.99,0.01:0.98,0.02:0.96,0.03:0.94,0.04:0.92,0.05:0.9,0.06:0.88,0.07:0.85,0.08:0.75,0.09:0.72,0.1:0.69,0.11:0.67,0.12:0.65,0.13:0.64,0.14:0.63,0.15:0.62`
  - Added 15m `tick2` execution gate to disable phase-3 FAK fallback (chase-only for remaining size):
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_15M_T2_NO_FAK=true`
  - New event logs:
    - `evcurve_t2_curve_override`
    - `evcurve_phase3_fak_disabled`
  - Code paths touched:
    - `src/evcurve.rs` config/env additions.
    - `src/main.rs` checkpoint skip (15m t3), t2 curve override gating, and t2 chase-only stop.

- `endgame_sweep_v1` tick schedule (live env):
  - Removed `t0` (`T-6000ms`) from active endgame ticks.
  - Updated `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_TICK_OFFSETS_MS=3000,1000,100`
    - `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_TICK_OFFSETS_SEC=3,1` (fallback only when ms list is unset)
    - `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_PER_TICK_USD_BY_OFFSET=3000:600,1000:1000,100:1000`
    - `EVPOLY_ENDGAME_PER_TICK_USD_BY_SYMBOL` remapped to 3 tick slots.
- `sessionband_v1` tau gating:
  - Added optional tau allowlist env parsing in `src/sessionband.rs`:
    - `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_ALLOWED_TAU_SEC` (comma-separated seconds, e.g. `1,2`).
  - Added runtime gate in `src/main.rs` SessionBand loop:
    - Skip and log `sessionband_skip_tau_not_allowed` when current `tau_sec` is not allowed.
  - Updated `.env` default live setting:
    - `EVPOLY_SESSIONBAND_ALLOWED_TAU_SEC=1,2`.

### 2026-02-27
- Execution accounting / fill attribution:
  - Fixed limit-fill attribution path in `src/trader.rs` to skip token-balance delta fill detection for real exchange orders.
  - Exchange order fills are now treated as canonical only via order-level reconcile (`get_order` / pending-order status), avoiding multi-order over-count when several ladder orders share the same token.
  - Impact: affects fill accounting and PnL tracking quality across limit-based strategies (`premarket_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `endgame_sweep_v1` when applicable), no strategy signal/risk logic change.
- EVcurve D1:
  - Lowered EV gap gate from `0.15` to `0.08` in `.env`.
  - Env changed: `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_D1_EV_GAP=0.08`.
  - Affects strategy path `evcurve_v1` daily (`1d`) `d1_ev` sub-rule for `BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP`.
- EVcurve D1 execution flow:
  - Removed D1 phase-3 `FAK` fallback; D1 now uses minute re-eval + limit chase only.
  - Added D1 cancel/unlock rule: if current best bid exceeds `max_buy_hold`, stop active signal and allow later hourly D1 signal for same symbol/day.
  - Added D1 single-active-signal lane (`symbol + day`) to prevent parallel workers.
  - Added D1 post-fill block rule: if a signal reaches `>=50%` of target notional fill, block further D1 signals for that symbol/day.
  - New event logs: `evcurve_d1_signal_started`, `evcurve_d1_recheck_pass`, `evcurve_d1_signal_canceled`, `evcurve_d1_signal_blocked_after_fill`, `evcurve_d1_signal_unlocked`.
  - Code path touched: `src/main.rs` EVcurve D1 worker/gating state.

### 2026-02-26
- Redemption lifecycle:
  - Changed scheduled redemption sweep cadence from hourly to interval-based with env control in `src/trader.rs`.
  - Added new env: `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_SWEEP_INTERVAL_HOURS` (default `1`, clamped `1..24`).
  - `.env` now sets `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_SWEEP_INTERVAL_HOURS=4` (run every 4h at configured minute).
  - Scheduler trigger label updated from `hourly_schedule` to `scheduled_interval`.
  - Retry log text updated to “next scheduled sweep” to match non-hourly cadence.
- EVcurve:
  - Removed `5m` from active EVcurve timeframes in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_TIMEFRAMES=15m,1h,4h,1d`
  - Removed `T-1m` checkpoints from classic EVcurve:
    - `15m`: now `T-5/T-4/T-3/T-2`
    - `1h`: now `T-15/T-10/T-5`
  - Added symbol-specific max-buy curve overrides:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_MAXBUY_CURVE_SOL`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_MAXBUY_CURVE_XRP`
  - SOL/XRP override curve:
    - `0%->0.99, 1%->0.98, 2%->0.96, 3%->0.94, 4%->0.90, 5%->0.87, 6%->0.84, 7%->0.79, 8%->0.76, 9%->0.73, 10%->0.70`
- Near-base skip threshold:
  - Updated global near-base threshold to `1.0 bps` in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_NEAR_BASE_SKIP_BPS=1.0`
  - Applies to strategies enabled for near-base gating (`endgame`, `evcurve`, `sessionband`).

### 2026-02-28
- Entry execution parallel lanes (arbiter workers):
  - Split arbiter submit queue into two independent worker pools in `src/main.rs`:
    - `critical` lane for `endgame_sweep_v1`, `endgame_revert_v1`, `sessionband_v1`.
    - `normal` lane for other entry strategies (`evcurve_v1`, `premarket_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, `mm_rewards_v1`, reactive/ladder/liqaccum paths).
  - Purpose: allow close-time strategies (`endgame` + `sessionband`) to enqueue/execute concurrently without waiting behind non-critical traffic.
  - New env knobs:
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_CRITICAL` (default `2`)
    - `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT_NORMAL` (fallback to legacy `EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_COUNT`, default `4`)
  - Worker telemetry now includes `worker_pool` field on key drop/backoff/cap events for lane visibility.

### 2026-03-01
- `evcurve_v1` overfill guard hardening (execution-layer):
  - Fixed cancel-status handling in `src/trader.rs` (`apply_cancel_candidates` and stale-ladder cancel reconcile path):
    - A cancel ACK is no longer treated as terminal `CANCELED`.
    - When `get_order` is still non-terminal (or temporarily fetch-fails after cancel ACK), status is kept `OPEN` conservatively.
  - Impact: prevents false local close of still-live orders, which could allow a new EVcurve chase submit while the previous order can still fill.

- `evcurve_v1` single-live-order guard (memory + DB):
  - Added `Trader::has_unconfirmed_buy_order_for_scope(...)` in `src/trader.rs`.
  - EVcurve chase loop in `src/main.rs` now requires BOTH checks before placing a new order:
    - DB open pending rows (`pending_orders`), and
    - in-memory unconfirmed pending trade guard.
  - New telemetry event: `evcurve_chase_pending_guard_mem_only` when memory sees an open order but DB has not reflected it yet.
  - Affects EVcurve chase submits across symbols/timeframes; goal is one live working order per EVcurve lifecycle scope at a time.

- `evcurve_v1` submit-cap + fill-sum guard tightening:
  - Added EVcurve-specific submit cap env and routing in `src/main.rs`:
    - New env: `EVPOLY_MAX_EVCURVE_SUBMITS_PER_TOKEN_PERIOD` (set in `.env`).
    - Arbiter submit-cap check now uses this EVcurve-specific cap for `evcurve_v1` instead of the generic submit cap.
  - Hardened EVcurve chase filled-notional recompute in `src/tracking_db.rs`:
    - `sum_entry_fill_notional_for_trade_key_like(...)` now dedupes `ENTRY_FILL` + `ENTRY_FILL_RECONCILED` by normalized order identity before summing.
    - Prevents duplicate counted notional when both canonical and reconciled fill events exist for the same order.
  - Added regression test:
    - `sum_entry_fill_notional_trade_key_like_dedupes_fill_and_reconciled_same_order`.
  - Affects EVcurve execution sizing/chase remainder logic across timeframes/symbols.

- `evcurve_v1` adaptive chase upgraded to ladder-style repricing (BUY side):
  - Added EVcurve ladder chase mode in `src/main.rs`:
    - Maintains 10-rung equal-size BUY ladder (1-cent spacing) per active chase scope.
    - Reprices by canceling stale rungs and reposting missing rungs as fair/max-buy shifts.
    - Supports both downshift and upshift repricing while respecting live `max_buy_live`.
  - Ladder path remains event-driven (`proxy_tick`, `pm_top_change`, fallback tick), with live `max_buy_curve` recompute from EVcurve decision logic already in loop.
  - Added T-minus cutoff stop for chase ladder across EVcurve timeframes:
    - Cancel remaining open ladder orders at `close_ts - cutoff_sec` (default 60s).
  - Added selective cancel helper in `src/trader.rs`:
    - `cancel_pending_orders_for_scope_order_ids(...)` for scoped partial cancel/reprice.
  - New EVcurve env knobs consumed in runtime (`.env`):
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_CHASE_LADDER_ENABLE`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_CHASE_LADDER_RUNGS`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_CHASE_LADDER_STEP_CENTS`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_CHASE_LADDER_CUTOFF_SEC`
  - Affects `evcurve_v1` chase execution path for all enabled EVcurve timeframes/symbols.

- `evcurve_v1` daily (`1d`) re-entry guard tightened after first fill:
  - Added DB-backed guard in `src/main.rs` before launching a D1 signal:
    - Skip new D1 signals when `count_entry_fills_for_strategy_condition(strategy_id, condition_id) > 0`.
    - New event log: `evcurve_d1_signal_skip_existing_fill`.
  - Updated in-worker D1 block rule:
    - `blocked_after_fill` now latches on **any** positive `final_filled_notional` (was `fill_ratio >= 0.5`).
  - Effect: once EVcurve gets any D1 entry fill for the day/condition, later D1 checkpoints for that symbol/day are blocked (including after restart).

- `evcurve_v1` daily (`1d`) first-fill hard stop fixed (minute chase):
  - Added explicit D1 in-loop stop-on-first-fill in `src/main.rs`:
    - As soon as `filled_notional > 0`, cancel remaining pending scope orders and stop the D1 chase loop.
    - New event log: `evcurve_d1_stop_on_first_fill`.
  - Added stronger pre-launch D1 fill gate in `src/main.rs`:
    - Existing condition-wide guard kept.
    - New token+period and symbol+period guards added via:
      - `count_entry_fills_for_strategy_token_period(...)`
      - `count_entry_fills_for_strategy_symbol_period(...)`
    - Prevents reopening D1 chase for same symbol/day after any prior fill, even if token side changes.
  - Added runtime D1 safety stop in chase loop:
    - If symbol+day already has any entry fill, cancel pending D1 scope orders and stop worker.
    - New event log: `evcurve_d1_stop_existing_symbol_fill`.
  - Added new tracking DB helper in `src/tracking_db.rs`:
    - `count_entry_fills_for_strategy_token_period(strategy_id, timeframe, period_timestamp, token_id)`.
    - `count_entry_fills_for_strategy_symbol_period(strategy_id, timeframe, period_timestamp, asset_symbol)`.
  - Affects: `evcurve_v1` timeframe `1d`, all enabled symbols (`BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP`).

- `mm_rewards_v1` upgraded to ladder+inventory execution for single-market reward test:
  - Replaced single-quote per side with fixed ladder quoting (`BBO1..BBO5`) using equal per-level size (`EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_SHARES_PER_SIDE`) and `EVPOLY_MM_LADDER_LEVELS`.
  - Added BBO participation guard: if per-level size exceeds `EVPOLY_MM_BBO1_MAX_SIZE_FRACTION` of top bid size, ladder shifts down one level (`BBO2..BBO6`) for that side.
  - Added PM-trade-driven toxic-flow handling (via Polymarket WS trade snapshots):
    - when a fresh trade prints through/at BBO1, bot cancels both BUY ladders and pauses repricing for `EVPOLY_MM_BBO_HIT_COOLDOWN_SEC`.
  - Added inventory skew control + maker weak-side exit:
    - uses live token balances; when weak-side inventory is larger than favored side, weak-side BUY ladder is paused/canceled.
    - weak-side inventory posts maker `SELL` GTC exits above average entry by `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_PROFIT_MIN` (no merge path).
    - favored side remains build/hold biased via `EVPOLY_MM_FAVOR_SIDE`.
  - Added Polymarket WS trade snapshot plumbing (`src/polymarket_ws.rs`, `src/api.rs`) and DB helper for average entry lookup (`src/tracking_db.rs`).
  - Updated MM env surface in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_LADDER_LEVELS=5`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_QUOTE_SHARES_PER_SIDE=200` (=> 1,000 shares per side total ladder)
    - `EVPOLY_MM_BBO_HIT_COOLDOWN_SEC=10`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_BBO1_MAX_SIZE_FRACTION=0.25`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_FAVOR_SIDE=UP`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_ENABLE=true`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_PROFIT_MIN=0.01`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_WEAK_EXIT_MAX_ORDER_SHARES=200`

- `mm_rewards_v1` ladder precision + weak-exit churn hardening:
  - Fixed ladder dedupe to use tick-key matching instead of cent-key matching in `src/main.rs`:
    - prevents `0.001` tick ladders from collapsing (e.g. `BBO1` + `BBO5` only).
    - BUY open-order matching now uses `price_key_tick(price, tick_size)` for target/existing ladder reconciliation.
  - Hardened MM order-terminal classification in `src/main.rs`:
    - MM stale-open and weak-exit tracking now treat only `Matched`/`Canceled` as terminal.
    - `Unmatched` no longer auto-forces stale/replace in MM ladder logic.
  - Added safer order-lookup error handling for MM:
    - transient `get_order` errors no longer auto-mark BUY rows as `STALE`.
    - terminal lookup errors are restricted to explicit missing/not-found patterns.
  - Added weak-side maker-exit submit throttle in `src/main.rs`:
    - tracks last submit per token and enforces minimum resubmit interval (derived from poll interval, floor 1s).
    - prevents hot-loop re-submits of the same weak-side `SELL` order.
    - adds failure backoff cooldown on weak-side exit submit errors (e.g. balance/allowance), with longer retry delay for balance-related failures.
  - Effect:
    - cleaner `BBO1..BBO5` ladder behavior on fine-tick books,
    - lower MM cancel/repost churn,
    - reduced pressure that contributed to WS lag bursts.

- `mm_rewards_v1` ladder stability + replenish timing fix:
  - Reduced MM rung dead-time caused by worker idempotency recent-done blocking:
    - added strategy-specific cooldown override for MM logical keys in `src/entry_idempotency.rs`.
    - new env override: `EVPOLY_ENTRY_RECENT_DONE_TTL_MM_REWARDS_MS` (set to `750` in `.env`).
  - Reworked MM BUY ladder reprice cancellation logic in `src/main.rs`:
    - no longer cancels whole scope whenever any row is off-target.
    - now cancels only duplicate same-price rows in active BUY ladder management (off-target rows are left to TTL/cooldown paths).
    - uses selective cancel API `cancel_pending_orders_for_scope_order_ids(...)` for less churn.
    - added per-token reprice cooldown (>=10s) before another BUY ladder reprice cancel pass can run.
  - Relaxed weak-side skew pause threshold in `src/main.rs`:
    - weak-side BUY pause now triggers only when weak inventory exceeds favored side by more than one full ladder size (`quote_shares_per_side * ladder_levels`), instead of one rung size.
  - Effect:
    - ladder levels persist longer,
    - missing rung replenishment happens faster,
    - fewer rapid cancel/repost cycles and fewer `RecentDone` rung lockouts.
  - Increased MM rewards arbiter strategy cap in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_ARB_STRAT_MM_REWARDS_MAX_USD` changed `1000 -> 10000` to avoid cap-throttling ladder replenishment while holding favored-side inventory.

- `mm_rewards_v1` ladder key + cooldown hit-gate fix (2026-03-01):
  - Fixed MM trade-key collision in `src/trader.rs`:
    - `EntryExecutionMode::MmRewards` key now uses 0.001 precision (`price_mills`) instead of 0.01 (`price_cents`).
    - key now also appends ladder suffix from request id (`l1..l5`) when available.
    - effect: rung-level pending/open dedupe no longer collapses multiple ladder levels into 1-2 keys.
  - Reduced over-aggressive cancel loops in `src/main.rs`:
    - BBO1 toxic-flow cancel is now ignored while cooldown is already active (no cooldown extension spam).
    - BBO1 toxic-flow detection only applies on sides actually quoting BBO1 (`start_offset == 0`), avoiding false full-ladder cancel when side is intentionally shifted to BBO2+.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` ladder placement/cancel behavior for all symbols/timeframes using MM rewards path.

- `evcurve_v1` size allocation reduced 50% (2026-03-01):
  - Updated EVcurve per-scope caps in `.env` (all symbols/timeframes):
    - `15m`: BTC/ETH `1000 -> 500`, SOL/XRP `400 -> 200`
    - `1h`: BTC/ETH `600 -> 300`, SOL/XRP `300 -> 150`
    - `4h`: BTC/ETH `800 -> 400`, SOL/XRP `400 -> 200`
    - `1d`: all symbols `2000 -> 1000`
  - Updated EVcurve daily fixed size in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_D1_SIZE_USD: 1000 -> 500`
  - Updated EVcurve strategy caps in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_STRATEGY_CAP_USD: 20000 -> 10000`
    - `EVPOLY_EVCURVE_D1_STRATEGY_CAP_USD: 12000 -> 6000`
  - Affects: `evcurve_v1` across `15m/1h/4h/1d` for `BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP`.

- Ops hardening: redemption visibility + DB/live cancel sync + merge sweep (2026-03-02):
  - Redemption sweep observability:
    - `src/trader.rs`: every redemption lifecycle update now emits structured `redemption_attempt_status` and stores recent attempt history (status/attempt/tx/error/rate-limit pause hint) for admin debugging.
    - `GET /admin/redemption/status` now includes `recent_attempts`.
    - New env: `EVPOLY_REDEMPTION_RECENT_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT` (`.env`).
  - MM and strategy cancel path DB/live sync hardening:
    - `src/trader.rs`: `cancel_pending_orders_for_scope*` now also reconciles/cancels DB-tracked OPEN rows that are missing in in-memory `pending_trades` (db-only rows), reducing stuck-open mismatches.
    - Affects all strategies using scope cancel paths, including `mm_rewards_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, and `endgame_sweep_v1`.
  - Merge complete-sets automation:
    - `src/trader.rs`: added scheduled/manual merge sweep (`merge_complete_sets`) that scans pending inventory per condition, checks live UP/DOWN balances, and merges when `min(UP,DOWN)` exceeds threshold.
    - `src/main.rs`: new admin endpoints:
      - `POST /admin/merge/sweep`
      - `GET /admin/merge/status`
      - `POST /admin/merge/condition?condition_id=0x...` (force single-condition merge test with pre-check output)
    - `.env`: added merge controls:
      - `EVPOLY_MERGE_SWEEP_ENABLE=true`
      - `EVPOLY_MERGE_SWEEP_MINUTE=40`
      - `EVPOLY_MERGE_SWEEP_INTERVAL_HOURS=1`
      - `EVPOLY_MERGE_MIN_PAIRS_SHARES=1`
      - `EVPOLY_MERGE_MAX_CONDITIONS_PER_SWEEP=10`
      - `EVPOLY_MERGE_RECENT_LOG_LIMIT=100`

- `mm_rewards_v1` event-driven execution + anti-pickoff/inventory controls (2026-03-02):
  - Converted MM quote loop in `src/main.rs` to event-driven wakeups from Polymarket WSS book updates:
    - new wait path uses `SharedPolymarketWsState::wait_for_market_update_after(...)` from `src/polymarket_ws.rs`.
    - fallback polling remains enabled via timeout only.
    - new envs in `.env` + `src/mm/mod.rs`:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_EVENT_DRIVEN_ENABLE`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_EVENT_FALLBACK_POLL_MS`
  - Improved reprice/cancel timeliness in `src/main.rs`:
    - fixed ladder reconciliation to cancel BUY orders not in current target ladder (not only duplicates).
    - reduced reprice gating from long static windows to configurable low-latency gate:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_REPRICE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`
    - added `mm_rewards_ladder_reprice_cancel` telemetry events.
  - Replaced broken BBO1 trade-hit detection (user-trade dependent) with live book adverse-move trigger in `src/main.rs`:
    - detects top-bid down-tick while we had a BBO1 quote and starts 10s cooldown with scope cancel-all.
    - new env:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_ADVERSE_TICK_TRIGGER_TICKS`
    - emits `mm_rewards_bbo1_hit_detected` + `mm_rewards_ladder_cooldown_started`.
  - Added MM constraints cache to avoid per-wake constraints refetch:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_CONSTRAINTS_CACHE_MS`
  - Added inventory caps and side throttles in `src/main.rs`:
    - favored/weak side BUYs now hard-stop when side inventory exceeds cap.
    - new envs:
      - `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_FAVOR_INVENTORY_SHARES`
      - `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_WEAK_INVENTORY_SHARES`
    - emits `mm_rewards_skip_side_inventory_cap`.
  - Strengthened weak-side maker-exit lifecycle telemetry in `src/main.rs`:
    - logs cancel due to no inventory, reprice-cancel, and terminal close with matched shares/estimated edge.
    - events:
      - `mm_rewards_weak_side_exit_canceled_no_inventory`
      - `mm_rewards_weak_side_exit_reprice_cancel`
      - `mm_rewards_weak_side_exit_closed`

- `mm_rewards_v1` robust inventory tracking + strategy-scope isolation (2026-03-03):
  - Added inventory janitor pass in `src/main.rs`:
    - periodically scans MM open inventory from `positions_v2` and injects forced per-market maintenance work items even when auto/target selection rotates away.
    - updates state via `mm_rewards_inventory_janitor_snapshot` telemetry and blocks mixed-scope conditions.
    - new env (optional): `EVPOLY_MM_INVENTORY_JANITOR_SEC` (default 15s in code).
  - Added cross-strategy scope guard in `src/main.rs`:
    - MM now checks open positions by `(condition_id, token_id)` and blocks quoting when non-MM strategy inventory overlaps.
    - emits `mm_rewards_scope_violation_blocked` and writes MM state reason `scope_violation_cross_strategy`.
  - Added DB APIs in `src/tracking_db.rs` for robust inventory reads:
    - `list_open_position_inventory_by_strategy`
    - `list_open_position_strategies_for_condition_token`
  - Improved MM exit SELL order tracking (competition-freeze exits + weak-side exits) in `src/main.rs`:
    - direct SELL submits are now mirrored into `pending_orders` with strategy scope.
    - terminal/cancel transitions update pending status (`FILLED` / `CANCELED` / `STALE`) so DB and live order state stay in sync.

- `mm_rewards_v1` imbalance rebalance + ladder churn fixes (2026-03-03):
  - Rebalance exit now works even when `favor_side_effective=none` in `src/main.rs`:
    - weak-exit path now also targets the currently blocked heavy side when inventory imbalance gate triggers.
    - this enables maker `SELL` reductions on the over-held side instead of only blocking new buys.
    - added `weak_exit_source` telemetry to distinguish `configured_weak_side` vs `imbalance_blocked_side`.
  - Reduced unnecessary MM cancel/reprice churn in `src/main.rs`:
    - reprice decision now keys off top anchor levels only (not bottom rung drift).
    - new config/env in `src/mm/mod.rs`: `EVPOLY_MM_REQUOTE_ANCHOR_LEVELS` (default `2`).
    - prevents full ladder churn from deep-level changes like `0.45 -> 0.44` while top ladder is unchanged.
  - Ladder generation updated in `src/main.rs` (`bid_ladder_prices_from_orderbook`):
    - now builds contiguous 1-tick ladders from an anchor level instead of sparse raw bid-level jumps.
    - removes large rung gaps (e.g. `bb1` then `bb5`) on thin books.
  - Rebalance-side quoting behavior improved in `src/main.rs`:
    - when imbalance is active, opposite-side rebalance quotes no longer auto-deepen due BBO1 max-size guard.
    - helps keep rebalance quotes nearer top of book during inventory repair.

- `mm_rewards_v1` inventory rebalance + requote stability fixes (2026-03-03):
  - Reworked bid ladder generation in `src/main.rs` (`bid_ladder_prices_from_orderbook`):
    - ladder now builds contiguous tick steps from an anchor level instead of sparse raw book jumps.
    - prevents wide rung gaps like `bb1 -> bb5` behavior on thin books.
  - Added anchor-level requote gating for MM BUY ladder reprices in `src/main.rs`:
    - reprice now keys off top-N anchor ladder levels (new `EVPOLY_MM_REQUOTE_ANCHOR_LEVELS`, default `2`) rather than bottom-rung drift.
    - reduces cancel/reprice churn caused by deep ladder-only changes.
  - Added imbalance-aware behavior in side quoting in `src/main.rs`:
    - when imbalance block is active, opposite-side rebalance quotes are allowed to stay closer to top-of-book (less forced deepening from BBO1-size guard).
  - Extended maker SELL exit logic in `src/main.rs`:
    - weak-exit path now also runs for imbalance-blocked token when no explicit favor side is active, so heavy inventory can be reduced via maker exits at profit targets.
    - adds `weak_exit_source` telemetry (`configured_weak_side` vs `imbalance_blocked_side`).
  - Config touched:
    - `src/mm/mod.rs`: new `requote_anchor_levels` with env `EVPOLY_MM_REQUOTE_ANCHOR_LEVELS`.

- `mm_rewards_v1` mode-cap/scoring/stale-suppression hardening (2026-03-03):
  - Fixed per-mode active-cap slot burn in `src/main.rs`:
    - `max_active_markets_per_mode` is now acquired only after side-level gates pass (not at candidate enqueue), so failed candidates do not consume mode slots.
    - affects all MM reward symbols/timeframes/modes.
  - Strengthened stale-order suppression path in `src/main.rs`:
    - stale reconcile now uses rotating cursor (`mm_stale_reconcile_cursor_by_scope`) plus capped-keying behavior.
    - when stale checks are throttled, submit dedupe keys are built from the checked/fresh slice instead of all historical rows, reducing false submit suppression by stale DB rows.
  - Corrected scoring guard q-min inputs in `src/main.rs`:
    - `check_local_scoring(...)` now receives real counterpart quote inputs (live opposite BUY quote when present, otherwise planned opposite ladder quote + size floor), instead of mirrored synthetic side sizes.
    - `q_min_ready` gating now reflects actual UP/DOWN quoteability for MM ladder submits.

- `mm_rewards_v1` imbalance-priority rebalance fix (2026-03-03):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` rebalancing precedence:
    - favor-side logic now applies only when inventory imbalance flag is not active.
    - when imbalance is active, bot selects rebalance mode by live BBO liquidity:
      - `reduce_heavy` (sell heavy side), or
      - `increase_light` (buy light side).
  - Updated weak-exit target selection:
    - weak-exit SELL now only targets imbalance-blocked heavy side during `reduce_heavy`.
    - weak-exit is skipped during `increase_light`.
  - Added rebalance-only gate:
    - when `reduce_heavy` is chosen, light-side rebalance BUY quoting is skipped for that cycle (`mm_rewards_skip_rebalance_reduce_heavy_only`).
  - Updated weak-exit pricing + size behavior in `src/main.rs`:
    - weak-exit profit is now adaptive to live spread ticks + imbalance severity (severe imbalance can flatten at touch).
    - fixed-size `+0.01` behavior is no longer the only driver.
    - weak-exit size now uses effective inventory (`wallet + reserved active exit`) to avoid `200 -> 1` churn from transient balance reads.
    - weak-exit can now run even when `avg_entry_price` is missing in DB by falling back to live BBO reference; this prevents imbalance-repair from stalling on legacy/manual inventory.
  - Added balance fallback cache in MM loop:
    - token balance reads now use last-good cached balance when API timeout/errors occur, reducing false zero-balance states and cancel/repost loops.
  - Added transient zero-balance guard in `src/main.rs`:
    - MM now requires 3 consecutive `0` balance reads before replacing a positive cached balance with `0`.
    - this prevents single-read balance flickers from flipping heavy/light side detection and causing wrong-side rebalance/cancel churn.
    - new telemetry event: `mm_rewards_balance_zero_guard`.
  - Added unconfirmed-zero imbalance skip in `src/main.rs`:
    - if one side reads `0` while the opposite side is positive and the zero streak is not confirmed (`<3`), MM skips imbalance-driven rebalance/weak-exit for that cycle.
    - prevents accidental wrong-side exits (e.g., selling YES when NO is actually heavy) during transient balance read glitches.
    - new telemetry event: `mm_rewards_skip_unconfirmed_zero_imbalance`.
  - Updated imbalance weak-exit arming in `src/main.rs`:
    - when imbalance is active, heavy-side weak-exit SELL is always armed on the blocked token (instead of only when `reduce_heavy` branch is selected).
    - this prevents rebalance stalls when light-side rebalance BUYs are blocked by scoring/q-min gates.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` (all symbols/timeframes/markets under MM loop).

- `mm_rewards_v1` startup weak-exit persistence guard (2026-03-03):
  - Updated startup cleanup flow in `src/main.rs`:
    - added `EVPOLY_STARTUP_CANCEL_ALL_ORDERS` (default `true`) and `EVPOLY_STARTUP_CANCEL_ALL_SKIP_IF_MM_REWARDS` (default `true`).
    - when MM rewards strategy is enabled and skip flag is on, startup `cancel_all_orders()` is skipped to avoid wiping active MM weak-exit SELL orders created for imbalance repair.
    - startup now logs explicit skip reason fields (`enabled`, `mm_rewards_enabled`, `skip_if_mm_rewards`) for auditability.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` inventory-repair exits across all enabled MM markets at bot restart.

- `mm_rewards_v1` ladder gating + rebalance-only routing hardening (2026-03-03):
  - Updated MM loop in `src/main.rs`:
    - inventory-imbalance markets now route to `rebalance_only` BUY behavior (`mm_rewards_rebalance_only_imbalance`): BUY ladders are canceled/skipped and weak-exit SELL logic handles balancing.
    - added ladder preflight planning (all-or-none): before any submit, each rung is validated for order floor + scoring.
    - if preflight fails (`non_scoring`, `below_order_floor`, or `full_ladder_required`), side is moved to `non_scoring_rebalance_only` and emits a single throttled event (`mm_rewards_rebalance_only_non_scoring`) instead of per-rung skip spam.
    - for normal markets, ladder coverage must satisfy full configured levels before posting new ladder orders.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` quote placement flow across all MM modes/markets.

- `mm_rewards_v1` auto-discovery coverage + per-mode multiplicity upgrade (2026-03-03):
  - Updated reward discovery in `src/api.rs`:
    - added `get_rewards_markets_gamma(...)` to pull reward-eligible markets from Gamma `/markets` (`order=volumeNum`, `ascending=false`, `active=true`, `closed=false`, `acceptingOrders=true`).
    - parses reward fields from Gamma payload (`clobRewards.rewardsDailyRate`, `rewardsMaxSpread`, `rewardsMinSize`, competitiveness).
  - Updated scanner in `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`:
    - merged rewards-page feed + Gamma reward feed into one deduped map by condition/slug.
    - improved matching with case-insensitive condition/slug lookup.
    - keeps reward-feed fallback enrichment via `get_market(condition_id)` so high-reward markets outside rewards-page top rows can still enter candidates.
    - replaced single-pick selector with `select_top_candidates_per_mode(..., per_mode)` to return multiple auto markets per mode.
  - Updated MM runtime integration in `src/main.rs`:
    - auto mode now consumes multiple candidates per mode (up to `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_ACTIVE_MARKETS_PER_MODE`) instead of one.
    - auto work-items are queued before target work-items in hybrid mode, so auto slots are not starved by target mode.
    - auto snapshot/heartbeat logs now report total selected markets (sum across all mode slots), and include per-slot index in snapshot rows.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` market selection/rotation for all symbols/timeframes/modes.

- `mm_rewards_v1` competition-freeze gate toggled OFF in live env (2026-03-03):
  - Updated `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_COMPETITION_HIGH_FREEZE_ENABLE=false`
  - Effect:
    - disables high-competition freeze blocking so selected auto MM markets can keep quoting instead of entering `competition_high_freeze` pause.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` all modes/markets in current runtime configuration.

- `mm_rewards_v1` near-expiry + low-reward exit mode gates (2026-03-04):
  - Updated `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`:
    - auto-candidate scanner now filters markets that are inside the configured near-expiry window (`EVPOLY_MM_NEAR_EXPIRY_EXIT_WINDOW_SEC`, default 24h), in addition to already-expired markets.
  - Updated `src/main.rs` MM runtime loop:
    - introduced effective reward-total tracking from rewards feed + market details.
    - if market enters near-expiry window or effective total reward drops below configured floor (`EVPOLY_MM_MIN_TOTAL_REWARD_QUOTE`, default 25), MM BUY quoting is disabled and market enters forced inventory-exit mode.
    - forced exit mode cancels BUY ladders, keeps weak-exit SELL logic active, and offboards auto-selected markets for replacement while inventory is unwound.
  - Updated `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MIN_TOTAL_REWARD_QUOTE=25`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_NEAR_EXPIRY_EXIT_WINDOW_SEC=86400`
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` all symbols/timeframes/modes (auto + target/hybrid runtime gating).

- `mm_rewards_v1` daily-reward-only gating + proxy-fed read path (2026-03-05):
  - Updated reward metric usage to `rewardsDailyRate` only (removed total reward estimation/horizon math and ignored `rewardsAmount` in MM decision paths).
  - Updated `src/api.rs`:
    - removed total-reward aggregation logic from rewards parsing/scoring paths.
    - rewards feed ranking now uses daily rate only.
    - added non-trading read proxy pool support via `POLY_MM_PROXIES` with round-robin + fallback for MM scanner/read flows (`get_all_clob_markets`, `get_rewards_markets_page`, `get_rewards_markets_gamma`, and `get_market_via_proxy_pool`).
    - kept direct path for trading-critical market discovery methods (`get_market_by_slug`, `get_market_from_event_slug`, `get_market`).
    - added MM read telemetry counters (`proxy/direct attempts, successes, 429s, errors`) exposed by `mm_read_telemetry_snapshot`.
  - Updated `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`:
    - `MarketRewardSnapshot` now tracks `reward_daily_rate` only.
    - scanner filters/ranking/force-include comparison now use daily rate only.
  - Updated `src/main.rs` MM runtime:
    - competition snapshot caches now store daily reward maps only.
    - reward eligibility and low-reward gate now evaluate daily reward only.
    - removed legacy total-reward telemetry fields in MM skip/exit events; logs now emit daily metric fields.
    - MM heartbeat includes proxy-vs-direct read telemetry counters.
  - Updated thresholds/defaults:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_FORCE_INCLUDE_REWARD_MIN=300`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MIN_REWARD_RATE_HINT=15`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MIN_TOTAL_REWARD_QUOTE=15` (now treated as daily gate metric while env name is kept).
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` all symbols/timeframes/modes (auto + target/hybrid reward selection and gating).

- `mm_rewards_v1` ladder floor autosize + background refresh + direct-first read fallback (2026-03-05):
  - Updated ladder preflight in `src/main.rs`:
    - allows weak-market degrade to 1 rung (`EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_MIN_FEASIBLE_LEVELS=1`) with telemetry `mm_rewards_ladder_degraded_to_one`.
    - replaced hard `below_order_floor` skip with rung autosizing to exchange floor (`required_notional_usd / price`) before submit.
    - added per-order guard `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_SHARES_PER_ORDER` and telemetry `mm_rewards_floor_size_upscaled`.
  - Updated MM refresh execution in `src/main.rs`:
    - added background worker for competition snapshot + auto ranked-candidate refresh.
    - hot MM quote loop now consumes background snapshot cache instead of running heavy scan calls inline.
    - moved activity sync to dedicated background worker (`mm_rewards_activity_sync` source=`background_worker`).
  - Updated read routing in `src/api.rs`:
    - non-trading MM reads are now direct-first with limited proxy fallback (`EVPOLY_MM_PROXY_FALLBACK_MAX`, default 2), replacing proxy-first chain behavior.
  - Updated env in `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_MIN_FEASIBLE_LEVELS=1`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_MAX_SHARES_PER_ORDER=10000`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_PROXY_FALLBACK_MAX=2`
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` all MM modes and selected markets.

- `mm_rewards_v1` no-ladder watchdog fix for sell-only/rebalance states (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` watchdog activity detection:
    - changed ladder-active check from `open_buy_orders > 0` to `open_buy_orders + open_sell_orders > 0`.
    - this prevents false `no_active_ladder_watchdog` tagging when MM is actively running sell-side/rebalance orders (`0/N` states).
  - No env default changes.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` all modes/markets where sell-only inventory balancing is active.

- `mm_rewards_v1` weak-exit side-flip cleanup for stale SELL ladders (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` weak-exit dynamic rebalance path:
    - when weak-exit active token flips token, bot now cancels stale open `SELL` orders on the opposite token for the same scope (`strategy_id`, timeframe, period, condition).
    - adds cooldown + in-memory cleanup for canceled opposite-side exits to avoid immediate flap re-submit.
    - emits `mm_rewards_weak_exit_side_flip_cleanup` telemetry with active/canceled token IDs and canceled row count.
  - No env default changes.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` dynamic imbalance rebalance (inventory exit ladder).

- `premarket_v1` enqueue late-guard + backpressure mode for pre-open reliability (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` premarket enqueue path:
    - added pre-enqueue time guard (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_ENQUEUE_GUARD_MS`, default `2500`) to stop building/flushing new ladder requests too close to market open.
    - added configurable premarket enqueue mode (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_ENQUEUE_MODE=await|bounded|try_send`, default `bounded`) with timeout (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_ENQUEUE_TIMEOUT_MS`, default `120`) for batch enqueue.
    - emits `premarket_enqueue_guard_blocked` and includes enqueue mode/timeout in batch telemetry.
  - Affects: `premarket_v1` batch ladder request enqueue behavior under queue pressure near open.

- `evsnipe_v1` burst-tick ingest hardening (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` + `src/evsnipe.rs`:
    - EVSnipe tick channel capacity now configurable via `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_TICK_CHANNEL_CAP` (default `65536`).
    - Binance trade stream spillway timeout now configurable via `EVPOLY_EVSNIPE_TICK_SEND_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `60ms`).
  - Affects: `evsnipe_v1` trade-tick buffering behavior during burst load (no strategy decision-model change).

- Arbiter dispatcher fast fanout (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` worker dispatcher:
    - dispatch now tries non-blocking `try_send` fanout across workers before falling back to awaited send.
    - reduces head-of-line blocking when a single worker queue is full.
  - Affects: all strategy request execution pools (`normal`, `premarket`, `endgame`, `endgame_revert`, `sessionband`, `evcurve`, `critical`) at dispatch layer only.

- `evcurve_v1` enqueue dedupe hardening (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/entry_idempotency.rs` `EnqueueDedupe` to support EVcurve-specific enqueue cooldown override.
  - New env: `EVPOLY_ENTRY_DEDUPE_COOLDOWN_EVCURVE_MS` (defaults to `max(EVPOLY_ENTRY_DEDUPE_COOLDOWN_MS, 5000)` when unset).
  - Affects: `evcurve_v1` producer-side enqueue dedupe behavior (reduces duplicate worker drops from rapid re-enqueue).

- `premarket_v1` dispatcher-side late-drop guard (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` arbiter dispatcher:
    - drops stale premarket ladder requests before worker fanout when market is already open.
    - logs `premarket_enqueue_guard_blocked` with source `arbiter_dispatcher`.
  - Affects: `premarket_v1` late request handling under backlog/queue delay.

- WS market lag reconnect policy hardening (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/polymarket_ws.rs` market stream lag handling:
    - small lag bursts can be ignored (`EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_LAG_IGNORE_MISSED_MESSAGES`),
    - reconnect-on-lag now requires both soft-error count and hard missed-message threshold (`EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_LAG_HARD_MISSED_MESSAGES`).
    - adds `polymarket_ws_market_stream_lag_ignored` telemetry.
  - Affects: all strategies consuming PM WS orderbook/user feed freshness paths.

- `mm_rewards_v1` watchdog gating cleanup (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` watchdog path:
    - `mm_rewards_watchdog_no_ladder` now only evaluates when market is expected to be actively quoting (`state in idle/quoting` and no active reason).
    - suppresses watchdog noise during explicit non-quoting states (rebalance/cooldown/blocked/unwind).
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` watchdog alerting and market-state telemetry.

- `mm_rewards_v1` background auto-scan snapshot fallback hardening (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` background refresh + loop apply path:
    - auto-ranked candidate snapshot now falls back to last-good ranked set when fresh scan is empty/error/timeout within `EVPOLY_MM_BG_RANKED_STALE_SEC` window (default `600s`).
    - main loop keeps last-good ranked candidates instead of clearing immediately on transient empty snapshots.
    - warmup suppression added: before first successful ranked snapshot, auto-scan empty errors are suppressed for the initial stale window.
    - added telemetry `mm_rewards_auto_snapshot_using_cached_ranked` and richer `mm_rewards_auto_scan_error` stale-age fields.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` auto market selection stability under transient API/scan gaps.

- `premarket_v1` scheduler-side late intent guard (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/strategy_decider.rs` premarket scheduler:
    - skips emitting premarket intents once inside enqueue guard window before open (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_ENQUEUE_GUARD_MS` with second-level safety rounding).
    - emits `strategy_premarket_skip_late_intent` telemetry.
    - enqueue guard default tightened from `2500ms` to `15000ms` for both scheduler and runtime enqueue checks.
    - near-open enqueue now uses tighter batch/chunk policy (`batch_chunk`, `enqueue_mode`, `enqueue_timeout_ms`) based on seconds-to-open.
  - Affects: `premarket_v1` intent generation, reducing late queue load and worker-side late rejects.

- PM WS refresh reconnection policy (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/polymarket_ws.rs` market/user loops:
    - periodic refresh no longer forces reconnect by default; reconnect only when discovered subscription targets actually change.
    - optional force behavior remains via `EVPOLY_PM_WS_RECONNECT_ON_REFRESH=true`.
    - market lag reconnect now honors cooldown (`EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_LAG_RECONNECT_COOLDOWN_SEC`) to prevent reconnect storms on repeated lag bursts.
    - market WS load can now shard across multiple subscription loops (`EVPOLY_PM_WS_MARKET_SHARDS`, default `2`).
    - adds refresh discovery failure telemetry and reconnect reason telemetry.
  - Affects: all strategies consuming PM WS feeds; reduces unnecessary stream churn.

- `premarket_v1` dispatcher backpressure drop policy (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` arbiter dispatcher premarket path:
    - when all premarket worker queues are full, dispatcher can drop immediately (`EVPOLY_PREMARKET_DISPATCH_DROP_IF_FULL`, default `true`) instead of blocking backlog growth.
    - premarket worker queue cap can be set independently (`EVPOLY_ENTRY_WORKER_QUEUE_CAP_PREMARKET`).
    - emits `premarket_dispatch_drop_full`.
  - Affects: `premarket_v1` queue behavior under burst load; aims to reduce stale late submissions.

- `mm_rewards_v1` auto selection + rebalance rearm update (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` + `src/mm/reward_scanner.rs`:
    - removed runtime per-mode active cap enforcement in MM auto processing (`max_active_markets_per_mode` no longer blocks candidate execution).
    - auto selection now uses reward-driven global top-N (`auto_top_n`) and assigns each candidate to best-fit mode, instead of per-mode slot caps.
    - on rebalance close (imbalance cleared), bot now auto-rearms ladder quoting by clearing local weak-exit state, canceling stale MM `SELL` exits for the scope, and clearing auto cooldown/offboard flags for that condition.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` auto market selection breadth and post-imbalance return-to-ladder behavior.

- `evsnipe_v1` market discovery pagination fix (2026-03-06):
  - Updated `src/evsnipe.rs` discovery loop:
    - fixed `events` pagination to advance offset by API page limit (event-offset semantics), not flattened market count.
    - removed premature stop based on accumulated flattened market count.
  - Affects: `evsnipe_v1` hit-market coverage (prevents skipping event ranges such as intraday strike ladders).

- `evsnipe_v1` strike parsing upgrade for SOL/XRP ladders (2026-03-06):
  - Updated `src/evsnipe.rs` strike parser:
    - supports Polymarket slug decimal encoding `pt` (e.g., `0pt8`, `1pt3`).
    - removed hard strike floor `<100` rejection; now allows positive sub-100 strikes.
    - treats decimal-like tokens as valid strike hints so low-price ladders parse correctly.
  - Added tests in `src/evsnipe.rs` for `$0.8`, `0pt8`, and `$70` parsing.
  - Affects: `evsnipe_v1` market inclusion for SOL/XRP low-price hit ladders.

- `mm_rewards_v1` background ranked scan timeout + limit increase (2026-03-05):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` background ranked scan timeout:
    - increased `scan_rank_auto_candidates` timeout from `25s` to `600s`.
  - Updated runtime config in `.env`:
    - set `EVPOLY_MM_AUTO_SCAN_LIMIT=1000` (was `200`).
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` auto-scan breadth and background ranked snapshot completion window.

- `mm_rewards_v1` wallet-backed MM inventory accounting + reconcile/reporting slice (2026-03-06):
  - Updated `src/tracking_db.rs` MM accounting/reporting paths:
    - added dedicated inventory-consumption accounting for merge/reconcile repairs using `inventory_consumed_units` / `inventory_consumed_cost_usd` on `positions_v2` and persisted consumption events.
    - added wallet-backed MM inventory/drift snapshot helpers using `wallet_positions_live_latest_v1`, `wallet_activity_v1`, and `positions_unrealized_mid_latest_v1` when present.
    - extended `summarize_mm_market_attribution(...)` to expose DB-vs-wallet inventory shares, drift, wallet value fields, and latest wallet activity metadata while keeping existing fields.
  - Updated `src/trader.rs` MM runtime/admin paths:
    - successful manual/scheduled merges now consume DB inventory through the dedicated non-SELL path instead of faking exit fills.
    - added callable MM inventory reconcile entrypoint and extended `mm_rewards_status` JSON with wallet-backed source flags and drift fields.
  - Updated `scripts/wallet_history_sync.py`:
    - wallet activity now stores `inventory_consumed_units` for merge-style activity when available.
    - unrealized mark sync now subtracts `inventory_consumed_units` from open remaining inventory.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` MM timeframe/reporting/reconcile accounting only; strategy execution logic is otherwise unchanged.

### 2026-03-07

- Runtime strategy toggle update (ops config only):
  - Updated `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_STRATEGY_ENDGAME_ENABLE=false`
    - `EVPOLY_STRATEGY_SESSIONBAND_ENABLE=false`
  - Affects: `endgame_sweep_v1` and `sessionband_v1` loops are disabled at process start/restart; no strategy logic/codepath changes.

- Arbiter execution pipeline hardening (all submit-path strategies via shared entry worker in `src/main.rs`):
  - Added per-request timing telemetry (`entry_execution_timing`) with decision/enqueue/dequeue/worker/submit timestamps and derived `queue_wait_ms` + `decision_to_submit_ms`.
  - Worker submit path now runs `execute_limit_buy(...)` in spawned tasks behind per-pool semaphore (`EVPOLY_ENTRY_SUBMIT_CONCURRENCY` and `EVPOLY_ENTRY_SUBMIT_CONCURRENCY_<POOL>`), reducing head-of-line blocking from slow post-order RTT.
  - Added submit-time late guard (`EVPOLY_ENTRY_SUBMIT_LATE_GUARD_MS`) to drop stale requests that reach submit too close to/after close, plus explicit `entry_submit_late_guard_blocked` event.
  - Affects entry behavior/timing for: `reactive_v1`, `premarket_v1`, `liqaccum_v1`, `snapback_v1_1`, `endgame_sweep_v1`, `endgame_revert_v1`, `evcurve_v1`, `sessionband_v1`, `evsnipe_v1`, `mm_rewards_v1`.

- Submit-cap hot-path DB contention reduction (`src/main.rs` shared entry worker):
  - Added in-memory submit-scope counter cache (`EVPOLY_ENTRY_SUBMIT_SCOPE_CACHE_TTL_MS`) for submit-cap checks, with DB refresh merge and post-submit cache increment.
  - Reduces repeated synchronous `count_entry_submits_for_scope(...)` reads in burst windows while preserving cap guard semantics.
  - Affects all strategies routed through the arbiter entry worker.

- `mm_rewards_v1` watchdog/state recovery hardening (`src/main.rs`):
  - Added watchdog auto-rearm timer (`EVPOLY_MM_WATCHDOG_REARM_SEC`) to avoid permanent `no_active_ladder_watchdog` lockout; market can re-enter quote attempts automatically.
  - Added explicit `rebalancing -> idle` auto-return when imbalance is cleared and no open orders remain.
  - Added `mm_rewards_state_action_mismatch` telemetry event when market state says `quoting` but no open orders exist.
  - Affects MM runtime state transitions and diagnostics only.

- Non-trading MM read resilience (`src/api.rs`):
  - Added per-attempt timeout (`EVPOLY_MM_READ_TIMEOUT_MS`) and jittered retry delay (`EVPOLY_MM_READ_RETRY_BASE_MS`, `EVPOLY_MM_READ_RETRY_JITTER_MS`) in proxy/direct fallback read path.
  - Applies only to read-only MM discovery/metadata requests; trading/cancel writes remain direct execution path.

- Runtime strategy toggle update (ops config only):
  - Updated `.env`:
    - `EVPOLY_STRATEGY_ENDGAME_ENABLE=true`
    - `EVPOLY_STRATEGY_SESSIONBAND_ENABLE=true`
  - Affects: `endgame_sweep_v1` and `sessionband_v1` loops are enabled at process start/restart; no strategy logic/codepath changes.

- `mm_rewards_v1` inventory-exit two-way ladder + status scope guardrails (2026-03-07):
  - Updated `src/main.rs` inventory-exit/rebalance path:
    - inventory-only and low-reward forced-exit modes no longer hard-disable all BUY quoting by reason flag.
    - forced inventory exit (outside near-expiry window) now keeps two-way behavior by allowing light-side BUYs while still blocking heavy-side BUYs.
    - bypassed `rebalance_reduce_heavy_only` suppression during forced inventory two-way mode so light-side deep bids are not skipped on heavily imbalanced markets.
    - added deep opposite-side BUY ladder mode for forced inventory exits: anchor from `best_bid - reward_range` (`max_spread`), then ladder downward by ticks (for example 56/55/54 when bid=59 and reward range=3c).
    - emits `mm_rewards_forced_exit_opposite_deep_ladder` telemetry with anchor/range/top/bottom details.
  - Follow-up correction (same day):
    - forced inventory two-way mode now places deep BUY ladder on the same heavy/exit token (e.g., NO exit keeps deep NO bids), and blocks opposite-token BUYs.
    - fixes mismatched behavior where deep bids could appear on the opposite outcome token.
    - bypassed weak-skew hard block (`mm_rewards_skip_weak_side_inventory_skew`) during forced inventory two-way mode so heavy-side deep bids can actually post.
  - Updated `src/trader.rs` `/admin/mm/status` payload:
    - added explicit `scope_notes` clarifying that `markets` is `status_scope` (`mm_market_state`) and can exclude global open-order/inventory markets.
    - documented global references for truth checks (`pending_orders` and `wallet_positions_live_latest_v1`).
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` inventory-exit quote behavior and MM status diagnostics interpretation.

- Runtime WS target-change debounce hardening (2026-03-07):
  - Updated `src/polymarket_ws.rs` market/user refresh loops:
    - added target-change debounce + hold-time gates before reconnecting on `subscription_target_changed`.
    - added symmetric-delta threshold filter (`bps`) to ignore small target diffs.
    - added telemetry for debounced/ignored/cleared target-change states.
  - New env controls:
    - `EVPOLY_PM_WS_TARGET_CHANGE_DEBOUNCE_SCANS`
    - `EVPOLY_PM_WS_TARGET_CHANGE_MIN_HOLD_SEC`
    - `EVPOLY_PM_WS_TARGET_CHANGE_MIN_DELTA_BPS`
  - Affects runtime WS stability for all strategies consuming Polymarket WS market/user streams.

- `mm_rewards_v1` dust-sell submits raw inventory size without reward min gating (2026-03-07):
  - Updated `src/trader.rs` `/admin/mm/dust-sell` path:
    - removed pre-submit market constraint gating (`minimum_order_size` / `rewards.min_size`) from dust cleanup flow.
    - dust sell now submits floored live balance size directly (`floor_units_for_order`) and keeps only dust-cap/min-submit guards.
    - added explicit telemetry flag `constraints_enforced=false` on dust sell submitted records.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` inventory cleanup behavior across all MM markets/timeframes; small residual positions are no longer blocked by reward `min_size` hints in pre-check logic.
  - Key env/code paths: `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_MIN_SUBMIT_SHARES`, `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_MAX_NOTIONAL_USD`, `src/trader.rs::dust_sell_mm_inventory`.

- `mm_rewards_v1` dust-sell pacing for sequential slow sweeps (2026-03-07):
  - Updated `src/trader.rs` `/admin/mm/dust-sell` loop:
    - added `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_INTER_ORDER_DELAY_MS` (default `1000`) and enforced delay between attempted dust orders.
    - dust sweep remains sequential and capped by `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_MAX_ORDERS`, but no longer bursts back-to-back auth/order calls.
  - Runtime env knobs used for deployment pacing:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_INTER_ORDER_DELAY_MS=1000`
    - `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_TIMEOUT_SEC=180` (so hourly wallet-sync dust call can finish 20 paced orders without client timeout).
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` hourly dust cleanup pacing/reliability only (no change to market-making quote logic).

### 2026-03-20

- `mm_sport_v1` ratio-breach hard cooldown to stop cancel/requote churn:
  - Updated `src/main.rs` MM Sport runtime path:
    - added condition-scoped ratio pause state (`ratio_pause_until_by_condition`).
    - on ratio breach, strategy now starts a fixed cooldown and suppresses new BUY quoting until cooldown expiry (inventory exit SELL path remains allowed).
    - cooldown is applied from all ratio breach sources: watchdog pair check, pair planning gate, and per-token runtime ratio gate.
    - heartbeat telemetry now reports `ratio_paused_markets`.
  - Updated `src/mm/mod.rs` config:
    - added `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_RATIO_PAUSE_SEC` (default `900` seconds).
  - Updated env templates:
    - `.env.example` and `.env.full.example` now include `EVPOLY_MM_SPORT_RATIO_PAUSE_SEC=900`.
  - Affects: `mm_sport_v1` pregame reward markets across all discovered sports conditions in active runtime.

- `mm_rewards_v1` dust-sell default max-notional increased:
  - Updated `src/trader.rs`:
    - `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_MAX_NOTIONAL_USD` default changed from `5` to `20` (still env-overridable).
  - Updated `.env.full.example` default to `EVPOLY_MM_DUST_SELL_MAX_NOTIONAL_USD=20`.
  - Affects: `mm_rewards_v1` dust cleanup sizing cap (`/admin/mm/dust-sell` and scheduled dust sweep paths).
